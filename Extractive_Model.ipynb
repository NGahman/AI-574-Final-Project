       "'Integrality of the Chern character in small codimension\\n\\nAbstract\\nWe prove an integrality property of the Chern character with values in Chow groups.\\nAs a consequence, we obtain a construction of the p-1 first homological Steenrod operations on Chow groups modulo p and p-primary torsion, over an arbitrary field.\\nWe provide applications to the study of correspondences between algebraic varieties.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nThe Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem of [5] can be expressed as the existence of the homological Chern character, a collection of group morphisms chi:K0′(X)→CHi(X)Q, which are compatible with projective push-forwards.\\nHere X is a (possibly singular) algebraic variety, K0′(X) the Grothendieck group of coherent sheaves, and CHi(X)Q the Chow group of X of algebraic cycles of dimension i, with Q-coefficients.\\nCompatibility with pull-backs is expressed by a Riemann-Roch type formula involving the Todd class.\\nGiven a prime number p, one can formulate the following statement describing a p-integrality property of the homological Chern character. Conjecture\\nLet X be a variety, and n a positive integer. Thenp[n/(p-1)]⋅chdimX-n[OX]∈im(CHdimX-n(X)Z(p)→CHdimX-n(X)Q).\\n The topological analog of this conjecture was stated and proved by Adams in [1, Theorem 1].\\nA more elementary proof of this topological result was later given by Atiyah [4, Theorem 7.1], under the quite restrictive assumption that X is a CW-complex whose homology has no torsion.\\nAlthough our approach is more akin to Atiyah\\'s than Adams\\' (where in particular Steenrod operations were used), no condition of such nature will appear.\\nIn [14, Theorem 4.4], we proved the conjecture for p=2 and n=1.\\nIn the present article, we prove it for n<p(p-1), and any p (Section 3).\\nIn particular we recover the previously obtained result, using an argument of different nature.\\nWe discuss in Appendix how this result can be extended to the more general setting of a scheme of finite type over a regular base.\\nLet us mention that the conjecture is an immediate consequence of the formula expressing compatibility of the homological Chern character with pull-backs when X is smooth, or more generally a local complete intersection variety.\\nThis remark can be used to prove the conjecture in the presence of some form of resolution of singularities.\\nUsing a result of Gabber on existence of regular alterations, we prove the conjecture for all n, when the characteristic of the base field is not p.\\nThe n-th Steenrod operation on Chow groups modulo p is an endomorphism of the Chow group with Z/p-coefficients which lowers dimension of cycles by n(p-1).\\nThe Steenrod operations constitute an efficient tool for studying rationality properties of projective homogeneous varieties.\\nThe classical constructions of the operations modulo p[6-8,21,30] do not work over a field of characteristic p.\\nIn [14], we constructed a weak form of the operation for p=2 and n=1, over any field.\\nWe later obtained the full version of this operation in [16].\\nIn the present paper, we construct a weak form of the n-th Steenrod operation modulo p, for p an arbitrary prime and n=1,…,p-1, over any field.\\nMore precisely, assuming that the conjecture above holds true for n≤m(p-1), and given any (possibly singular) variety X over an arbitrary field, we construct for each integer i such that 0<i≤m, a morphism of graded abelian groups Ti:CH•(X)⊗Z/p→CH˜•-i(p-1)(X)⊗Z/p.\\nHere CH˜d is the quotient of the Chow group CHd by its torsion subgroup.\\nThese morphisms are compatible with proper push-forwards, external products, and extension of the base field.\\nWe also provide a Riemann-Roch type formula expressing compatibility with pull-backs along local complete intersection morphisms.\\nThus we construct operations T1,…,Tp-1 unconditionally, and operations Ti for all i>0 when the characteristic of the base field is not p.\\nThe operation Ti corresponds-up to a sign-to the i-th Steenrod operation modulo p when i≤p.\\nMore generally, the total operation ∑iTi corresponds to the inverse of the total Steenrod operation ∑jSj.\\nWe explain how to recover the operation induced by Sj on reduced Chow groups (the reduced Steenrod operation) from the operations Ti.\\nIn the last part of this paper, we prove the degree formula corresponding to the operations Ti.\\nSince we only proved the conjecture in general for small values of n, we need to work with varieties of dimension ≤p(p-1) (note that the dimension p(p-1) is allowed).\\nWe first give a bound on the p-adic valuation of the index of a projective variety in terms of its dimension and of the Euler characteristic of its structure sheaf.\\nThen we deduce from the degree formula that the Severi-Brauer variety of a central division algebra of prime degree p is strongly p-incompressible.\\nThis is a new statement when the base field has characteristic p.\\nFinally, we show that the Euler characteristic of the structure sheaf of a smooth projective variety of dimension p-1, possessing a special correspondence but no zero-cycle of degree prime to p, is prime to p.\\nThis extends a statement of Rost to arbitrary base fields.\\nNotations\\nVarieties. We fix a base field k.\\nA variety is a finite type, separated, quasi-projective scheme over k.\\nA morphism of varieties is a morphism of schemes over k.\\nWe will denote by V ar/k this category.\\nWe also denote by Proj/k the category with the same objects, but with morphisms only those which are projective.\\nThe function field of an integral variety X shall be denoted by k(X).\\nIntegral elements.\\nFor a number α∈Q, we write [α] for the greatest integer ≤α.\\nLet A be an abelian group.\\nFor any commutative ring R we write AR for A⊗ZR, and, if S is another commutative ring containing R, we write AR⊂S=im(AR→AS).\\nNote that if A is a ring, then AR⊂S is a subring of AS.\\nLet p be a prime number.\\nWhen R=Z(p) (the subring of Q consisting of fractions with denominator prime to p), S=Q, and x∈AQ-{0}, we denote by vp(x) the greatest integer r such that p-r⋅x∈AZ(p)⊂Q.\\nWe set vp(0)=∞.\\nWhen x,y∈AQ, we have vp(x+y)≥min(vp(x),vp(y)).\\nIf A is a commutative ring, M an A-module, a∈AQ, and m∈MQ, we have (1)vp(a⋅m)≥vp(a)+vp(m).\\nGrothendieck groups of schemes.\\nWe denote by K0(-) the presheaf of rings on V ar/k which associates to a variety X the Grothendieck ring of locally-free coherent OX-modules.\\nWe denote by K0′(-) the functor Proj/k→Ab which associates to a variety X the Grothendieck group of coherent OX-modules.\\nHere, and in the rest of the paper, the notation Ab stands for the category of abelian groups.\\nLocal complete intersection morphisms.\\n(See [9, Appendix B.7.6].) These are the morphisms of varieties f:Y→X which can be factored as p∘i, with i a regular closed embedding, and p a smooth morphism.\\nSuch a morphism admits a virtual tangent bundle Tf=i∗[Tp]-[Ni]∈K0(Y), where Tp is the tangent bundle of p, and Ni the normal bundle of i.\\nThis element does not depend on the choice of the factorization.\\nThere are pull-backs f∗:CH(X)→CH(Y) and f∗:K0′(X)→K0′(Y).\\nWe call a variety X a local complete intersection variety if its structural morphism x:X→Spec(k) is a local complete intersection morphism.\\nWe denote by TX∈K0(X) the virtual tangent bundle Tx of x.\\nTopological filtration.\\nLet X be a variety, and d an integer.\\nWe denote by K0′(X)(d) the subgroup of K0′(X) generated by those OX-modules whose support has dimension ≤d.\\nIt coincides with the subgroup generated by elements of type i∗[OZ], where i:Z↪X is a closed embedding, and dimZ≤d.\\nWhen f:Y→X is a projective morphism, we have f∗K0′(Y)(d)⊂K0′(X)(d).\\nWhen f:Y→X is a local complete intersection morphism of relative dimension n, we have [11, Theorem 83 and Lemma 84]f∗K0′(X)(d)⊂K0′(Y)(d+n).\\nThe associated graded group is denoted by grdK0′(X)=K0′(X)(d)/K0′(X)(d-1).\\nThere is a natural transformation of functors Proj/k→Ab(2)φ-:CH(-)→grK0′(-) which respects the gradings [9, Example 15.5].\\nIt is moreover compatible with pull-backs along local complete intersection morphisms, external products, and extension of the base field (see [15, Section 3]).\\nChow cohomology ring.\\nLet X be a possibly singular variety, and consider the operational Chow ring CH(X⟶idX) (see [9, Definition 17.3]).\\nWhen resolution of singularities is available, this ring is commutative [9, Example 17.4.4].\\nWe denote by CH(X) the subgroup of elements x∈CH(X⟶idX) such that for any morphism f:Y→X the element f∗x belongs to the center of CH(Y⟶idY).\\nThe group CH(X) has a natural structure of a CH(X)-module.\\nWe obtain a presheaf of commutative rings CH on V ar/k, in which Chern classes of vector bundles take their values [9, Proposition 17.3.2].\\nWhen E is a vector bundle over a variety X, we write Td(E)∈CH(X)Q for the total Todd class [9, Example 3.2.4].\\nThe individual components are Tdi(E)∈CHi(X)Q.\\nChern character.\\nThe homological Chern character is a natural transformation of functors Proj→Abch:K0′(-)→CH(-)Q.\\nThis is the map τ of [9, Theorem 18.3].\\nIts component of dimension i will be chi:K0′(-)→CHi(-)Q.\\nAdams operations.\\n(See [28]) Let l∈Z-{0}.\\nThe l-th homological Adams operation is a natural transformation of functors Proj→Abψl:K0′(-)→K0′(-)⊗Z[1/l].\\nPart 1.\\nIntegrality of the Chern character\\nWe fix a prime number p.\\nWe say that p-integrality holds in codimension ≤c if the following statement is true.\\nStatement 1.1\\nLet X be a variety and d≥0 an integer.\\nThen for all integers n such that 0≤n≤c, and all elements x∈K0′(X)(d), we havevp(chd-n(x))≥-[np-1].\\n We prove in Section 3 that p-integrality holds in codimension ≤p(p-1)-1.\\nMoreover, we prove in Section 4 that p-integrality holds in codimension ≤m for all m when the characteristic of the base field is not p.\\nWe expect that this assumption is superfluous.\\nAdams operations and Chern character\\nWe fix an element l∈Z-{0}.\\nThe sole purpose of this section is to prove, in Proposition 2.4, the relation for n≥0, (3)chn∘ψl=l-n⋅chn.\\nThis is certainly very classical, at least so is the cohomological counterpart of this statement.\\nDue to the lack of suitable reference, we give some details in this section.\\nWe shall need to introduce some notations, but except in Appendix, the only thing used in the sequel will be the relation (3).\\nCohomological variants.\\nThe cohomological (i.e. usual) Chern character [9, Example 3.2.3] is a morphism of presheaves of rings on V ar/kch:K0(-)→CH(-)Q.\\nThe cohomological (i.e. usual) l-th Adams operation is a morphism of presheaves of rings on V ar/kψl:K0(-)→K0(-), sending the class of a line bundle to its l-th tensor power.\\nWhen X is connected, the ring K0(X) has an augmentation rank:K0(X)→Z sending the class of a vector bundle to its rank.\\nBott\\'s class.\\nConsider the Laurent polynomial in the variable xtl(x)=1-xl1-x.\\nThere is a unique morphism of presheaves of abelian groups on V ar/kθl:K0(-)→(Z[1/l]⊗K0(-))× such that for all line bundles L, θl(L)=tl[L∨].\\nNote that this does not follow [28], where θl(L)=tl[L].\\nK-theory with supports.\\nWhen X is a closed subvariety of a variety W, the notation K0X(W) stands for the Grothendieck group of complexes of locally free OW-modules, which are acyclic off X, modulo the classes of acyclic complexes.\\nIt has a natural structure of a K0(W)-module.\\nWe denote by CH(X→W) the bivariant Chow group (see [9, Definition 17.1]).\\nThere are maps -∩[OW]:K0X(W)→K0′(X),-∩[W]:CH(X→W)→CH(X) which are isomorphisms when W is smooth ([12, Lemma 1.9] and [9, Proposition 17.4.2]).\\nWe write chXW:K0X(W)→CH(X→W)Q for the local Chern character [9, Section 18.1], and ψXl:K0X(W)→K0X(W) for the Adams operation with supports [12, Section 4].\\nAssume that W is smooth, and that x∈K0X(W).\\nThen the homological Chern character is given by the formula [9, Theorem 18.3, (3)], (4)ch(x∩[OW])=(Td(TW)⋅chXW(x))∩[W], while homological Adams operations are defined by the formula [28, Théorème 7](5)ψl(x∩[OW])=(θl(-TW)⋅ψXl(x))∩[OW].\\nComposing the maps chXW with projections CH(X→W)Q→CHj(X→W)Q, we obtain individual components (chXW)j.\\nWe now prove a few lemmas that will be used to obtain (3).\\nLemma 2.1\\nLet X be a connected variety.\\nWe have in CH(X)Q, for all u∈K0(X),Td(-u)⋅ch∘θl(u)=lrank(u)⋅Td(-ψl(u)).\\nProof\\nAssume that L is a line bundle.\\nThen ch∘θl(L)=ch(tl[L∨])=tl(ch[L∨])=tl(x-1)=1-x-l1-x-1, where x=ec1(L).\\nThen Td(-L)⋅ch∘θl(L)=1-x-1c1(L)⋅1-x-l1-x-1=1-x-lc1(L)=l⋅1-e-c1(L⊗l)c1(L⊗l)=l⋅Td(-L⊗l).\\nThus the claimed formula holds when u is the class of a line bundle.\\nBoth sides of this formula define morphisms of presheaves of abelian groups on V ar/kK0(-)→(CH(-)Q)×.\\nTherefore, we can conclude with the splitting principle. □\\nLemma 2.2\\nLet X be a variety.\\nWe have in CH(X)Q, for all u∈K0(X),Td(ψl(-u))=∑i≥0li⋅Tdi(-u).\\nProof\\nFor a line bundle L, we have Td(-L⊗l)=∑i≥0(-c1(L⊗l))i(i+1)!=∑i≥0li⋅(-c1(L))i(i+1)!=∑i≥0li⋅Tdi(-L), proving the formula for u the class of a line bundle.\\nThe lemma follows as above from the splitting principle. □\\nLemma 2.3\\n[19, Theorem 3.1]\\nLet X be a closed subvariety of a smooth variety W . We have in CH(X→W)Q, for x∈K0X(W),chXW(ψXl(x))=∑j≥0lj⋅(chXW)j(x).\\nProposition 2.4\\nLet n≥0 be an integer.\\nWe have chn∘ψl=l-n⋅chn.\\nProof\\nIt will be enough to prove that the two sides of the formula have the same effect on any element of K0′(X), for X a connected variety.\\nChoose a closed embedding X↪W into a smooth connected variety W of dimension d.\\nThen, we have in CH(X)Q, for all x∈K0X(W), ch∘ψl(x∩[OW])=Td(TW|X)⋅(chXW(θl(-TW)⋅ψXl(x))∩[W])=(Td(TW|X)⋅ch∘θl(-TW|X))⋅(chXW(ψXl(x))∩[W])=l-d⋅Td(ψl(TW|X))⋅(chXW(ψXl(x))∩[W])=∑i=0dli-d⋅Tdi(TW|X)⋅∑j≥0lj⋅((chXW)j(x)∩[W])=∑n=0dl-n⋅∑i+j=d-nTdi(TW|X)⋅((chXW)j(x)∩[W])=∑n=0dl-n⋅chn(x∩[OW]).\\nThe first equality is (4) and (5).\\nThe second follows from [9, Proposition 18.1, (c)].\\nFor the third one, we use Lemma 2.1.\\nThe fourth one uses Lemmas 2.2 and 2.3.\\nThe last one is again (4). □\\nIntegrality in arbitrary characteristic\\nProposition 3.1\\nLet l∈Z-{0}, X a variety, and x∈K0′(X)(d) . Thenψl(x)-l-d⋅x∈K0′(X)(d-1)⊗Z[1/l].\\nProof\\nWhen l=p is a prime number, this is [15, Lemma 6.1].\\nActually we obtained this result using the formula θp(-d)=p-d,(d∈Z), which is true when p is an arbitrary element of Z-{0}.\\nTherefore, we can obtain the proposition using the proof of [15, Lemma 6.1].\\nAlternatively, one can assume that X is integral and d=dimX.\\nThen we have an exact sequence 0→K0′(X)(d-1)⊗Z[1/l]→K0′(X)(d)⊗Z[1/l]→K0′(Spec(k(X)))⊗Z[1/l]→0, and the statement is a consequence of [16, Lemma 4.2]. □\\nTheorem 3.2\\np-integrality holds in codimension ≤p(p-1)-1.\\nProof\\nWe must prove Statement 1.1 with c=p(p-1)-1.\\nFor all d, the case n=0 immediately follows from [9, Theorem 18.3, (5)].\\nIn particular, the theorem is proved when d=0.\\nWe can therefore proceed by induction on d, and assume that n>0.\\nFor all i≥1, define an integer ap(i)={1 if p-1|i0 otherwiseso that we have (6)[np-1]=[n-1p-1]+ap(n).\\nSince 0<n<p(p-1), we can use Lemma 3.3 below to choose an integer l, prime to p, such that (7)vp(ln-1)=ap(n).\\nWrite, in K0′(X)⊗Z[1/l], using Proposition 3.1, ψl(x)=l-d⋅x+l-d-m⋅α with α∈K0′(X)(d-1), and m≥0.\\nThen applying ld+m⋅chd-n to the relation above, and using Proposition 2.4, we obtain in CHd-n(X)Qlm⋅(ln-1)⋅chd-n(x)=chd-n(α).\\nBecause of (7), we get vp(chd-n(x))=vp(chd-n(α))+ap(n).\\nWe conclude using (6) and the induction hypothesis for α∈K0′(X)(d-1). □\\nLemma 3.3\\nLet p be a prime number.\\nThen there exists an integer l, prime to p, with the following properties(a)\\nIf n is not divisible by p-1, then ln-1 is not divisible by p.\\n(b)\\nIf n is not divisible by p(p-1), then ln-1 is not divisible by p2.\\nProof\\nTake for l an integer whose class modulo p2 generates the cyclic group (Z/p2)×.\\nThen one checks easily that the class of l modulo p generates the cyclic group (Z/p)×. □\\nRemark 3.4\\nIn contrast with [14] where the normalization procedure was used, we do not use geometric arguments here.\\nWe only use basic relations between Adams operations, Chern character, and filtration on K-theory.\\nUsing [3, (1.5)] in place of Proposition 3.1, and [2, Theorem 5.1, (vi)] in place of Proposition 2.4, one could proceed as above to replace the assumption \"X is without torsion\" by \"n<p(p-1)\" in [4, Theorem 7.1], thus giving an elementary proof of the p-primary part of [1, Theorem 1], for small n.\\nNote also that the approach of [14] is limited by nature to schemes whose normalization morphism is of finite type, while Theorem 3.2 is valid for more general schemes (see Appendix).\\nConsequences of Gabber\\'s Theorem\\nIn this section, we use the theorem of Gabber asserting that, over a field of characteristic different from p, any integral variety X admits a regular alteration of degree prime to p.\\nThis means that there exists a projective morphism Z→X, generically finite of degree prime to p, with Z regular.\\nSome details can be found in [10,17].\\nIf d≥0 is an integer, the d-th Todd number is (8)τd=∏p primep[d/(p-1)].\\nProposition 4.1\\nLet X be a local complete intersection variety.\\nThen, for all nτn⋅chdimX-n[OX]∈CH(X)Z⊂Q.\\nProof\\nLet x:X→Spec(k) be the structural morphism of X.\\nThen by [9, Theorem 18.3, (4) and (5)], ch[OX]=ch∘x∗[OSpec(k)]=Td(TX)⋅x∗∘ch[OSpec(k)]=Td(TX)⋅[X].\\nThen the proposition follows from Lemma 6.3 below. □\\nTheorem 4.2\\nLet p be a prime different from the characteristic of the base field.\\nThen p-integrality holds in codimension ≤c, for any c.\\nProof\\nWe must prove Statement 1.1 with c arbitrary large.\\nWe proceed by induction on d, the case d=0 being obvious.\\nIt is enough to consider the case X integral of dimension d, and x=[OX].\\nUsing Gabber\\'s theorem, we choose f:Z→X a projective morphism, with Z a regular connected variety of dimension d, and such that [k(Z):k(X)]=λ is prime to p.\\nThen there is an element δ∈K0′(X)(d-1) such that f∗[OZ]=λ⋅x+δ.\\nThus vp(chd-n(x))≥min(vp(f∗chd-n[OZ]),vp(chd-n(δ)))≥min(vp(chd-n[OZ]),vp(ch(d-1)-(n-1)(δ))).\\nWe conclude using Proposition 4.1 for Z, and the induction hypothesis on δ. □\\nThe combination of Theorems 3.2 and 4.2 implies the following.\\nCorollary 4.3\\nLet X be a variety over a field of characteristic p, and d be an integer.\\nThen for all integers n such that 0≤n<p(p-1), and all elements x∈K0′(X)(d), we haveτn⋅chd-n(x)∈CH(X)Z⊂Q.\\nPart 2.\\nOperations on Chow groups\\nConstruction\\nWe proceed as in [14] to derive operations from the integrality property of the Chern character stated above.\\nThis follows [4, Section 7].\\nLet A be an abelian group.\\nThen the natural map (9)AZ⊂Q⊗Z/p→AZ(p)⊂Q⊗Z/p, is an isomorphism.\\nThis group can also be described as A modulo p and p-primary torsion.\\nBy this we mean the quotient of A by p⋅A+T, where T is the subgroup of elements a∈A such that pn⋅a=0 for some integer n>0.\\nWe assume that p-integrality holds in codimension ≤m(p-1), for some integer m.\\nLet q>0 be an integer.\\nFor every integer i such that 0<i≤m, we see using Statement 1.1, for d=q and n=i(p-1), that the association x↦pi⋅chq-i(p-1)(x) induces a natural transformation of functors Proj→AbK0′(-)(q)→CHq-i(p-1)(-)Z(p)⊂Q.\\nLet X be a variety, and x∈K0′(X)(q-1)⊂K0′(X)(q).\\nThen pi⋅chq-i(p-1)(x)=p⋅(pi-1⋅ch(q-1)-(i(p-1)-1)(x)).\\nUsing Statement 1.1 for d=q-1 and n=i(p-1)-1, we see that this element belongs to p⋅CHq-i(p-1)(X)Z(p)⊂Q.\\nThis gives a natural transformation of functors Proj→AbgrqK0′(-)⊗Z/p→CHq-i(p-1)(-)Z(p)⊂Q⊗Z/p.\\nComposing on the left with the map (2), and on the right with the inverse of the map (9) with A=CHq-i(p-1)(-), we obtain a natural transformation of functors Proj→AbTi:CHq(-)⊗Z/p→CHq-i(p-1)(-)Z⊂Q⊗Z/p.\\nIt will be convenient to agree that T0:CHq(-)⊗Z/p→CHq(-)Z⊂Q⊗Z/p is the quotient map modulo the image modulo p of p-primary torsion.\\nThe inverse Todd genus\\nWe consider the power series in the variable x(10)R(p)(x)=∑i=0∞(-1)i⋅xpi-1.\\nThere is a unique morphism of presheaves of abelian groups on V ar/kr(p):K0(-)→(CH(-)⊗Z/p)× such that for L a line bundle, r(p)(L)=R(p)(c1(L)).\\nIndividual components are denoted ri(p):K0(-)→CHi(p-1)(-)⊗Z/p.\\nUsing the terminology of [24], this class will be the inverse Todd genus of the operation T=∑iTi constructed in the previous section.\\nIn this section we describe a relation between the characteristic class r(p) and the Todd class.\\nRemark 6.1\\nThe inverse Todd genus of the usual Steenrod operation ∑iSi is defined by the power series W(p)(x)=1+xp-1.\\nOne easily checks that x⋅R(p)(x) is the left inverse of x⋅W(p)(x) for the law given by composition of power series with coefficients in Z/p.\\nWe begin by stating an easy argument that we will use repeatedly below.\\nLemma 6.2\\nLet A be a commutative ring, M an A-module, au∈AQ and mu∈MQ for u=0,…,i(p-1) satisfyingvp(au)≥-[up-1]andvp(mu)≥-[up-1].Then we have an equality in MZ(p)⊂Q⊗Z/p,∑u=0i(p-1)(pi⋅au⋅mi(p-1)-u)=∑j=0i(pj⋅aj(p-1))⋅(pi-j⋅m(i-j)(p-1)).\\nProof\\nWe compute, for all u, using (1), vp(au⋅mi(p-1)-u)≥vp(au)+vp(mi(p-1)-u)≥-[up-1]-[i(p-1)-up-1]=-[up-1]-i-[-up-1].\\nThis integer is always ≥-i; hence the elements delimited by the parentheses in the formula of the statement belong to the submodule MZ(p)⊂Q⊂MQ.\\nMoreover, when u is not divisible by p-1, this integer is >-i.\\nThis gives the requested formula modulo p. □\\nLemma 6.3\\nWe have, for all integers n, and all x∈K0(X)vp(Tdn(x))≥-[np-1].\\nProof\\nLet X be a variety.\\nThen the set of elements 1+y with y∈⨁n>0p-[n/(p-1)]⋅CHn(X)Z(p)⊂Q is a subgroup B(X) of (CH(X)Q)×.\\nIf f:Y→X is a morphism of varieties, then f∗B(X)⊂B(Y).\\nThus we can define a presheaf of abelian groups C on V ar/k by C(-)=(CH(-)Q)×/B(-).\\nWe have a morphism of presheaves of abelian groups on V ar/kν:K0(-)→C(-),x↦Td(-x).\\nWhen L is a line bundle, we have by definition of the Todd class, ν[L]=∑n≥0(-c1(L))n(n+1)!.\\nThen ν vanishes on the classes of line bundles, because of Lemma 6.5 below.\\nThe splitting principle allows us to conclude.11\\nIf f:Y→X is a projective bundle, one can check that the pull-back C(X)→C(Y) is injective using the fact that f∗:CH(X)→CH(Y) is a split monomorphism.\\n□\\nProposition 6.4\\nLet j≥0 be an integer, X a variety, and x∈K0(X) .\\nThen the elements pj⋅Tdj(p-1)(-x) and rj(p)(x) have same image inCHj(p-1)(X)Z(p)⊂Q⊗Z/p.\\nProof\\nWe consider the presheaf of commutative rings on V ar/kCH˜(-)=CH(-)Z(p)⊂Q⊗Z/p.\\nThe characteristic class r(p) induces a morphism of presheaves of abelian groups on V ar/kr(p)˜:K0(-)→CH˜(-)×.\\nBy Lemma 6.3, we can consider the association ρ:K0(-)→CH˜(-),x↦∑j≥0pj⋅Tdj(p-1)(-x).\\nIt is clearly compatible with arbitrary pull-backs.\\nIt sends sums to products because the total Todd class has the same property, and because of Lemmas 6.2 and 6.3.\\nLet L be a line bundle.\\nThen by definition of the Todd class, we have ρ[L]=∑j≥0pj(j(p-1)+1)!⋅(-c1(L))j(p-1).\\nUsing Lemma 6.5 below, we see that the j-th coefficient is an element of Z(p).\\nMoreover, we see that it belongs to pZ(p) if and only if j(p-1)+1 is not a power of p.\\nOtherwise, when say j(p-1)+1=pi, we see using Lemma 6.6 below, that the j-th coefficient is (-1)i modulo pZ(p).\\nIn view of (10), the characteristic class ρ coincides with r(p)˜ on the classes of line bundles, and the claim follows from the splitting principle. □\\nLemma 6.5\\n[20, p.10]\\nLet p

Thenvp(n!)=n-sp-1.\\nLemma 6.6\\nLet i≥0 be an integer, and p a prime number.\\nWe have(pi)!⋅p-pi-1p-1=(-1)imodp.\\nProof\\nWe proceed by induction on i.\\nFor i=0 this is immediate.\\nLet i≥1 and consider the set Ui={1,2,…,pi-1,pi}.\\nThe product of all the integers sitting between two consecutive multiples of p is congruent to -1 modulo p, by Wilson\\'s Theorem.\\nThus the product of all elements of Ui which are non-divisible by p is congruent modulo p to (-1)pi-1=-1.\\nThe product of the pi-1 elements of Ui which are divisible by p is ppi-1⋅(pi-1)!.\\nHence we have (pi)!⋅p-pi-1p-1=(-1)⋅ppi-1⋅(pi-1)!⋅p-pi-1p-1=-p-pi-1-1p-1⋅(pi-1)!.\\nBy the induction hypothesis, this is (-1)i, as requested. □\\nProperties\\nLet p be a prime number.\\nIn this section, we assume that integrality holds in codimension ≤m(p-1), and describe some functorial properties of the operations T0,…,Tm constructed in Section 5.\\nProposition 7.1\\nLet f:Y→X be a local complete intersection morphism.\\nLet i be an integer such that 0≤i≤m . Then we haveTi∘f∗=∑j=0irj(p)(-Tf)⋅f∗∘Ti-j.\\nProof\\nWe have, by [9, Theorem 18.3, (4)], chn-i(p-1)∘f∗=∑u=0i(p-1)Tdu(Tf)⋅f∗∘chn-i(p-1)+u.\\nIn view of Lemmas 6.3 and 6.2 and Theorem 3.2, we have, in the group CHn-i(p-1)(Y)Z(p)⊂Q⊗Z/p, pi⋅chn-i(p-1)∘f∗=∑j=0i(pj⋅Tdj(p-1)(Tf))⋅f∗∘(pi-j⋅chn-(i-j)(p-1)).\\nSince the map (2) is compatible with f∗, Proposition 6.4 allows us to conclude. □\\nApplying Proposition 7.1 to the structural morphism of a local complete intersection variety, we obtain the formula computing the effect of the operation Ti on regular cycles.\\nCorollary 7.2\\nLet X be a local complete intersection variety (e.g. a regular variety).\\nLet i be an integer such that 0≤i≤m . ThenTi[X]=ri(p)(-TX)⋅[X].\\nProposition 7.3\\nLet X and Y be two varieties over the same field.\\nThen for x∈CHd(X), and y∈CHe(Y), and 0≤i≤m, we haveTi(x×y)=∑j=0iTj(x)×Ti-j(y).\\nProof\\nLet a∈K0′(X)(d) (resp.\\nb∈K0′(X)(e)) be an element such that φX(x)=amodK0′(X)(d-1) (resp.\\nφY(y)=bmodK0′(Y)(e-1)), where φ- is the map (2).\\nWe have, by [9, Example 18.3.1] (and [9, Theorem 18.3, (5)]) chd+e-i(p-1)(a×b)=∑u=0i(p-1)chd-u(a)×che+u-i(p-1)(b).\\nBy Lemma 6.2, this gives in CHd+e-i(p-1)(X×Y)Z(p)⊂Q⊗Z/p, pi⋅chd+e-i(p-1)(a×b)=∑j=0i(pj⋅chd-j(p-1)(a))×(pi-j⋅che-(i-j)(p-1)(b)).\\nWe can conclude using the fact that φ is compatible with external products. □\\nAssume that X is a local complete intersection variety.\\nDefine, for i≤m, the i-th cohomological operation Ti by the formula Ti=∑j=0irj(p)(TX)⋅Ti-j:CH•(X)→CH•-i(p-1)(X)Z⊂Q⊗Z/p.\\nProposition 7.4\\nLet X and Y be local complete intersection varieties over a common field, and i an integer such that 0<i≤m.(i)\\nFor x∈CH(X),y∈CH(Y), we haveTi(x×y)=∑j=0iTj(x)×Ti-j(y).\\n(ii)\\nWhen X is smooth, x,y∈CH(X), we haveTi(x⋅y)=∑j=0iTj(x)⋅Ti-j(y).\\n(iii)\\nThe operation T0 is the identity.\\n(iv)\\nTi[X]=0.\\n(v)\\nAssume that X is smooth, and let x∈CH1(X) .\\nThen Ti(x)=-xp if i=1, and Ti(x)=0 otherwise.\\n(vi)\\nIf f:Y→X is a local complete intersection morphism, then Ti∘f∗=f∗∘Ti.\\n(vii)\\nLet f:Y→X be a projective morphism.\\nLet Tf=TY-f∗TX∈K0(Y) . ThenTi∘f∗=f∗∘∑j=0irj(p)(-Tf)⋅Ti-j.\\nProof\\nStatement (i) follows from Proposition 7.3, statement (vi) from Proposition 7.1, and (vii) from the fact that the operations Ti are compatible with projective push-forwards.\\nThen (ii) follows from (i) and (vi), statement (iv) from (vi) and the obvious computation for X=Spec(k).\\nStatement (iii) is a consequence of the definition of T0.\\nWe now prove (v).\\nWe can assume that x=[Z] for some integral closed subvariety Z of X.\\nSince X is locally factorial, Z is a locally principal divisor.\\nIn particular, the closed embedding f:Z↪X is regular, and Z is a local complete intersection variety.\\nThen, using (iv) and (vii), where Tf=-f∗[OX(Z)], we obtain for i>0, Ti(x)=Ti∘f∗[Z]=f∗∘Ti[Z]-f∗(c1(f∗[OX(Z)])p-1⋅Ti-1[Z])=-c1(OX(Z))p-1⋅f∗∘Ti-1[Z].\\nThis is zero when i>1 by (iv).\\nWhen i=1, this is, by (iii), -c1(OX(Z))p-1⋅[Z]=-c1(OX(Z))p=-xp, as requested. □\\nFinally, we mention the following.\\nProposition 7.5\\nLet L/k be a field extension.\\nThen, for all varieties X, all x∈CH(X), and i such that 0≤i≤m, we haveTi(xL)=Ti(x)L.\\nProof\\nThis follows from [14, (2) and Theorem 3.1, (d)]. □\\nRelation with Steenrod operations\\nIn this section, we compare the operations Ti with the Steenrod operations constructed by other methods.\\nWe therefore make the assumption that the characteristic of the base field is different from p.\\nConsider the i-th homological Steenrod operation of, say, [7]Si:CH•(-)⊗Z/p→CH•-i(p-1)(-)⊗Z/p, and write S=∑iSi.\\nSince S0=id, we have S=id+f, where for every variety X the induced endomorphism fX of CH(X)⊗Z/p is nilpotent.\\nWe write T′X for the left inverse of SX; this defines a natural transformation of functors V ar/k→Ab with components Ti′:CH•(-)⊗Z/p→CH•-i(p-1)(-)⊗Z/p.\\nWe have T0′=id and, for i>0, one can express Ti′ inductively as (11)Ti′=-∑j=1iTi-j′∘Sj.\\nProposition 8.1\\nWe have for i≤pTi′=(-1)i⋅Si.\\nProposition 8.2\\nAssume that X is a smooth variety. ThenT′[X]=r(p)(-TX)[X].\\nProof\\nProof of Propositions 8.1 and 8.2\\nLet Z be a variety.\\nIt is proven in [22, Lemma 5.2 and Proposition 3.1] that the homological Steenrod operations S• induce an action of the Steenrod Z/p-algebra S on CH(Z)⊗Z/p.\\nThe operation Sj acts as the element Pj∈S (in case p=2 we write Pj for Sq2j).\\nUsing (11), we see that the action of Tj′ on CH(Z)⊗Z/p coincides with the action of the conjugate c(Pj) of Pj, in the sense of [23, Section 7].\\nLet bi for i∈N-{0} be indeterminates.\\nIf R=(r1,r2,…) is a sequence of non-negative integers, we write bR for the product b1r1b2r2⋯.\\nBy [23, Corollary 6], the morphism S[[b1,b2,…]]→S[[x]],bi↦(-1)pi-1p-1⋅xpi-1=(-1)i⋅xpi-1modp sends the total Steenrod operation ∑RPR⋅bR to ∑jc(Pj)⋅xj(p-1).\\nWe obtain Proposition 8.1 by noticing that for i≤p the element Pi is the only basis element of type PR of the same dimension as c(Pi).\\nMoreover, by [22, Proposition 5.3, (2)], we obtain T′[X]=d(-TX)[X], where d is the total Chern class ∑RcR⋅bR evaluated at bi=(-1)i.\\nInspection of the value of d on a line bundle reveals that d=r(p), establishing Proposition 8.2. □\\nProposition 8.3\\nAssume that the base field is of characteristic different from p . Let i be any integer ≥0 . Then we have a commutative diagram\\nProof\\nBy Lemma 8.4 below and Proposition 7.5, we can assume that the base field is perfect.\\nSince both operations are compatible with proper push-forwards, it will be enough to compare their values in CHd-i(p-1)(X)Z⊂Q⊗Z/p on the class [X], when X is an integral variety of dimension d.\\nUsing Gabber\\'s theorem, we find a projective morphism f:Z→X, with Z smooth of dimension d, and f dominant with [k(Z):k(X)]=λ an integer prime to p.\\nLet ν∈(Z/p)× be the inverse modulo p of λ.\\nThen, using Corollary 7.2, Ti[X]=ν⋅Ti(λ⋅[X])=ν⋅Ti∘f∗[Z]=ν⋅f∗∘Ti[Z]=ν⋅f∗(ri(p)(-TZ)⋅[Z]).\\nA similar computation, and Proposition 8.2, show that Ti′[X] has the same value, as requested.□\\nLemma 8.4\\nLet X be a variety over a field k of characteristic ≠p . Let F/k be a perfect closure.\\nThen scalars extension induces an injective morphismCH(X)Z⊂Q⊗Z/p→CH(XF)Z⊂Q⊗Z/p.\\nProof\\nLet L/k be a finite field extension.\\nA transfer argument shows that CH(X)Q→CH(XL)Q is injective, hence so is CH(X)Z⊂Q→CH(XL)Z⊂Q, and therefore so is CH(X)Z⊂Q⊗Z(p)→CH(XL)Z⊂Q⊗Z(p).\\nWhen the degree of the extension L/k is prime to p, the transfer induces a splitting of this monomorphism, so that CH(X)Z⊂Q⊗Z/p→CH(XL)Z⊂Q⊗Z/p is injective.\\nBy [29, Theorem 5.20 and Proposition 5.26], the group CH(XF) is the direct limit of the groups CH(XL) with L/k a finite subextension of F/k.\\nSuch an extension L/k is of degree prime to p because it is a purely inseparable extension of a field of characteristic ≠p.\\nUsing the fact that the functor A↦AZ⊂Q⊗Z/p commutes with any exact functor commuting with tensor products, we see that the natural map colimk⊂L⊂F[L:k]<∞(CH(XL)Z⊂Q⊗Z/p)→CH(XF)Z⊂Q⊗Z/p is an isomorphism.\\nThe lemma follows. □\\nRemark 8.5\\nProposition 8.3 actually gives some new information about Steenrod operations modulo p in characteristic not p.\\nDenote by μ:CH(-)⊗Z/p→CH(-)Z⊂Q⊗Z/p the natural quotient map.\\nLet X be a variety, and (12)K(X)=ker(CH(X)→grK0′(X)).\\nThen K(X) consists of torsion elements.\\nLet Kp(X) be its image in CH(X)⊗Z/p.\\nOne can ask the following question: \"What is the set E of operations Q on Chow groups modulo p such that μ∘Q vanishes on Kp(X), for all X?\"\\nBy construction, we have Ti(Kp(X))=0; hence a consequence of Proposition 8.3 is that Ti′∈E, for all i.\\nOn the other hand when p=2 and j>1, then the cohomological Steenrod square S2j-1 does not belong to E (see [16, Remark 8.4]).\\nThis can also be used to obtain information on grK0′(X).\\nFor example, a direct consequence of Proposition 8.3 is that gr2K0′(D) contains non-zero 3-torsion, where D is the variety of [27] (over a field of characteristic zero).\\nRemark 8.6\\nOne can use the operations Ti to recover some of the results of [15].\\nAssume that X is a variety and L/k an extension of the base field such that CH(XL) is torsion-free.\\nThen Ti is an endomorphism of CH(XL)⊗Z/p.\\nWe set S0=id, and define inductively, for n>0 and x∈CH(XL)⊗Z/p, Sn(x)=-∑i=1nTi∘Sn-i(x).\\nLet Ch¯(X)=im(CH(X)⊗Z/p→CH(XL)⊗Z/p) be the reduced Chow group modulo p.\\nSince the operations Ti commute with extension of the base field, they send the subgroup Ch¯(X)⊂CH(XL)⊗Z/p to itself.\\nTherefore, the association x↦Sn(x) induces an operation of this subgroup, the n-th reduced Steenrod operation.\\nPart 3.\\nDegree formula and applications.\\nWe now describe some consequences of the results obtained above.\\nIn order to make unconditional statements, we restrict ourselves to applications of the fact that p-integrality holds in codimension ≤p(p-1)-1 (Theorem 3.2).\\nWe fix prime number p.\\nWhen X is a projective variety, we let nX be the positive generator of the image of the degree map CH(X)→Z.\\nWe also set nX(p)=pvp(nX).\\nLet x:X→Spec(k) be the structural morphism of X.\\nWe denote by χ(OX) the integer corresponding to x∗[OX] under the identification K0′(Spec(k))=Z.\\nIn other words, χ(OX)=∑j≥0(-1)jdimkHj(X,OX).\\nNote that ch[OSpec(k)]=[Spec(k)], so that χ(OX)=deg∘ch0[OX].\\nIndex and Euler characteristic\\nWe begin by giving a restriction on the possible values of the index nX of a projective variety X, in terms of two integers which do not change under field extensions: the dimension of X and the Euler characteristic χ(OX).\\nProposition 9.1\\nLet X be a projective variety of dimension <p(p-1) . Thenvp(nX)≤[dimXp-1]+vp(χ(OX)).\\nProof\\nWe have, by Theorem 3.2, vp(ch0[OX])≥-[dimXp-1], which means that there is an integral zero-cycle x∈CH0(X), and an integer λ prime to p such that x=λ⋅p[dimX/(p-1)]⋅ch0[OX].\\nTaking degrees, we obtain nX|λ⋅p[dimX/(p-1)]⋅χ(OX), whence the result. □\\nLet X be an integral projective variety of dimension i(p-1), with i>0.\\nWe define in Z/nX(p)tp(X)=pi-1⋅χ(OX)modnX(p).\\nThen Proposition 9.1 amounts to saying that we have, when i<p, p⋅tp(X)=0modnX(p).\\nThe same conclusion holds for any i>0 when X is a local complete intersection variety by Proposition 4.1, or if p-integrality holds in codimension ≤i(p-1).\\nRemark 9.2\\nBy [26, Corollary 1], the class tp(X) vanishes when the base field is perfect of characteristic p.\\nRemark 9.3\\nAssume that i<p.\\nLet up(X)∈CH0(X) be a cycle whose class modulo p and p-primary torsion is Ti[X].\\nThen its image up¯(X) in CH0(X)Z(p)⊂Q satisfies up¯(X)=pi⋅ch0[OX]modpCH0(X)Z(p)⊂Q.\\nHence degup¯(X)=pi⋅χ(OX)modpnXZ(p) and degup(X)p=pi-1⋅χ(OX)modnX(p).\\nThus the class tp(X) corresponds to the Rost numbers for a certain combination of Steenrod operations (see [22, p.\\n20]) under the map Z/nX→Z/nX(p).\\nWhen f:Y→X is a morphism between varieties of the same dimension, then the integer degf is defined as the degree of the extension of function fields when f is dominant, and as zero otherwise.\\nTheorem 9.4\\nDegree Formula\\nLet f:Y→X be a morphism of integral projective varieties of the same dimension i(p-1) with 0<i≤p . Thentp(Y)=degf⋅tp(X)modnX(p).\\nProof\\nWe have in K0′(X)(13)f∗[OY]=degf⋅[OX]+δ with δ∈K0′(X)(i(p-1)-1).\\nThis element δ can be written as a linear combination of elements of type [OZ], for Z a closed subvariety of X, with dimZ≤i(p-1)-1.\\nNote that nX(p)|nZ(p) for such Z.\\nThe result is obtained by projecting (13) to K0′(Spec(k)), and using Proposition 9.1.□\\nThus the class tp(-) is defined for varieties of dimension i(p-1) when i is arbitrary, satisfies the degree formula when i≤p, and is of p-torsion when i≤p-1.\\nRemark 9.5\\nLet X be a projective variety of dimension i(p-1), with i≤p.\\nAssume that there is a morphism f:X→Y, for some projective variety Y, such that f∗[X]∈K(Y) (see (12)).\\nThen tp(X)=0modnY(p).\\nCorrespondences modulo p\\nLet X and Y be varieties, with Y projective and X integral.\\nA correspondence α:X↝Y is an element α∈CH(X×Y).\\nThe multiplicity of α is the image of α under the composite CH(X×Y)→CH(Spec(k(X))×Y)⟶degCH(Spec(k(X)))=Z.\\nStrong p-incompressibility\\nLet p be a prime number.\\nFollowing [18, p.\\n150], we call an integral projective variety X strongly p-incompressible if the existence of a correspondence X↝Y of multiplicity prime to p, with Y an integral projective variety of dimension ≤dimX and such that vp(nY)≥vp(nX), implies that dimY=dimX, and that there exists a correspondence Y↝X of multiplicity prime to p.\\nProposition 10.1\\nLet p be a prime number, and i an integer such that 0<i≤p . Let X be an integral projective variety with vp(nX)≥i . Assume that χ(OX) is prime to p . Then dimX≥i(p-1) .\\nIn case of equality, X is strongly p-incompressible.\\nProof\\nAssume that dimX<i(p-1).\\nThen in particular dimX<p(p-1), and Proposition 9.1 gives i≤vp(nX)≤[dimXp-1]+vp(χ(OX))<i, a contradiction.\\nHence dimX≥i(p-1).\\nNow we assume that dimX=i(p-1).\\nWe proceed as in the proof of [22, Theorem 7.2] - but as we include the case i=p, we cannot use the relation p⋅tp(X)=0.\\nLet Y be an integral projective variety of dimension ≤dimX, with a correspondence X↝Y of multiplicity prime to p, and such that vp(nY)≥vp(nX).\\nWe can assume that there is an integral variety Z with dimZ=dimX, and two projective morphisms f:Z→X and g:Z→Y↪Y′, such that degf is prime to p.\\nHere Y′ is the product of Y with a projective space of appropriate dimension: in particular dimY′=dimX and nY′=nY.\\nSince by Theorem 9.4 we have degf⋅tp(X)=tp(Z)modnX(p), we see that tp(Z) is non-zero modulo nX(p), hence modulo nY(p).\\nNow by the same theorem we have degg⋅tp(Y′)=tp(Z)modnY(p), hence degg is non-zero and g is dominant, so that Y=Y′ and dimY=dimX.\\nThen Z gives a correspondence Y↝X of multiplicity prime to p.\\nFor further reference, let us mention that we also obtain that tp(Y) is non-zero modulo nY(p). □\\nLet X be the Severi-Brauer variety of a central division algebra of degree pn, with p a prime number.\\nThen X is strongly p-incompressible when the characteristic of the base field is not p[22, Example 7.2, Theorem 7.2].\\nAccording to [18, Example 2.3], it is unknown whether X is strongly p-incompressible when the characteristic is p.\\nWe can treat the case n=1 with Proposition 10.1.\\nCorollary 10.2\\nThe Severi-Brauer variety of a central division algebra of prime degree p is strongly p-incompressible.\\nIndex reduction formula\\nWe mentioned in [13, Section 4.1] that the index reduction formula of [31, Corollary (B)] can be generalized to base fields of arbitrary characteristic.\\nThe results obtained here allow us to additionally remove all assumptions of regularity.\\nProposition 10.3\\nLet X and Y be integral projective varieties, of dimensions ≤i(p-1) for some i≤p . Assume that vp(nY)≥vp(nX)≥i, p|χ(OY), and χ(OX) is prime to p . Then there is no correspondence X↝Y of multiplicity prime to p.\\nProof\\nThe first part of Proposition 10.1 implies that dimX=i(p-1); hence dimY≤dimX.\\nIf such a correspondence exist, the last sentence of the proof of Proposition 10.1 would imply that χ(OY) is prime to p, a contradiction. □\\nRost\\'s correspondences\\nThe operations Ti can be used to extend the case n=1 in [25, Theorem 9.1] to arbitrary fields.\\nTheorem 10.4\\nLet X be a smooth projective variety of dimension p-1 . Assume that X has a special correspondence in the sense of [25, Definition 5.1], with b=1 . Assume moreover that X has no zero-cycle of degree prime to p . Thendeg(r(p)(-TX)⋅[X])≠0modp2.By Remark 9.3, this means that the integer χ(OX) is prime to p.\\nProof\\nWe only sketch how [25, Proof of Theorem 9.1] can be adapted.\\nThis proof only involves cycles of dimension ≤2p-3; in particular, the only Steenrod operation used is the first one.\\nMoreover, since the degree map factors through the Chow group modulo torsion, there is no loss in using the operation with values in this group.\\nAll the properties needed are contained in Proposition 7.4. □\\nAcknowledgments\\nThe support of EPSRC Responsive Mode grant EP/G032556/1 is gratefully acknowledged.\\nI thank Alexander Vishik for his interest in this work, and for the useful suggestions that he made.\\nSchemes over a regular base\\nLet S be a regular connected scheme of finite Krull dimension.\\nThen, as explained in [9, Section 20.1], most results of [9] for varieties over fields extend to arbitrary schemes of finite type over S. There are only two difficulties :\\n- the lack of external product in general.\\n- one should use relative dimension dimS instead of the usual dimension.\\nIn particular, the homological Chern character can be constructed in this generality.\\nThe purpose of this appendix is to explain how Theorem 3.2 (and thus the construction of the operations Ti, i=0,…,p-1) can be extended to this setting.\\nLet VS be the category of schemes quasi-projective over S. Homological Adams operations are constructed in [28] for objects of VS.\\nThe results of Section 2 extend without difficulty to the category VS.\\nHowever, both proofs of Proposition 3.1 used the fact that X contains a non-empty open regular subscheme.\\nWe now give a proof that works for arbitrary objects of VS, using the notations introduced in the beginning of Section 2.\\nProposition A.1\\nLet l∈Z-{0}, X∈VS, and x∈K0′(X)(d) . Thenψl(x)-l-d⋅x∈K0′(X)(d-1)⊗Z[1/l].\\nProof\\nAs before, one can assume that X is integral and d=dimSX, and we have the exact sequence 0→K0′(X)(d-1)⊗Z[1/l]→K0′(X)(d)⊗Z[1/l]⟶u∗K0′(Spec(k(X)))⊗Z[1/l]→0.\\nChoose a closed embedding X↪W, with W connected and smooth over S. Let x be the generic point of X, and write Wx for Spec(OW,x).\\nThen the map u∗ in the sequence above may be identified with the map f∗:K0X(W)⊗Z[1/l]→K0{x}(Wx)⊗Z[1/l] and the composite u∗∘ψl corresponds to f∗∘(θl(-TW/S)⋅ψXl)=θl(-TW/S)⋅ψ{x}l∘f∗.\\nThe action of θl(-TW/S)∈K0(W) on K0{x}(Wx) factors through K0(Wx).\\nSince Wx is a local scheme, the rank map K0(Wx)→Z is an isomorphism.\\nThe rank of θl(-TW/S) is l-rankTW/S[16, (2), p.\\n6].\\nSince W is flat over S, we have dimSW=tr.deg.(k(W)/k(S))=rankTW/S.\\nThus θl(-TW/S) acts on K0{x}(Wx) by multiplication by l-dimSW.\\nBy [12, (A4\\') p.\\n263, see also Proof of Proposition 5.3], ψ{x}l is multiplication by lcodim(X,W).\\nThis gives, using [9, Lemma 20.1, (2)], u∗∘ψl=lcodim(X,W)-dimSW⋅u∗=l-dimSX⋅u∗.\\nWe can now conclude using the exact sequence above. □\\nAs a consequence, Theorem 3.2 immediately extends to the category VS.\\nFinally, let X be a scheme of finite type over S (possibly non quasi-projective).\\nProceeding as in the proof of [9, Lemma 18.3, (3)], we see that there is always an envelope X′→X over S, such that X′∈VS.\\nMoreover we see, using [9, Lemma 20.1, (3)], that K0′(X′)(d)→K0′(X)(d) is surjective, for any d.\\nUsing this remark, Theorem 3.2 is easily extended to the category of schemes of finite type over S.\\n\\n'"

Each specialization of the operators Mλ¯ from Section 5 gives commutative algebra containing the operator M-e1¯.  The operators T1,…,Tn-1 have the same form as the operators T1,…,Tn-1 of Section 3 in the case R=Cn, and the proof of invariance under their action follows by Proposition 3.5.  In this way we recover operator (1.2) (under assumption that ℏ/η∈Z) for the case of DAHA of type A and derive further known and new generalized Macdonald-Ruijsenaars operators starting from other root systems.  Consider restriction of the operators (5.18) in the case αn∉S0.  It follows that the operators Mλ for the affine root system S coincide with the operators Mλ from Section 5 at the corresponding specialization.  Indeed, the operators Mλ in this case have the form (2.31) withgλ(x)=∏α∈Rˆλ(1-tαuαeα(x)/2)(1+tαuα-1eα(x)/2)1-eα(x).\n",

      "Summary for Marine and terrestrial environmental changes in NW Europe preceding carbon release at the Paleocene-Eocene transition: As there is no direct evidence for regional uplift causing further restriction of the North Sea Basin associated with the CIE onset, increased regional precipitation may have been the major cause of increased C/N ratios (elevated fluvial runoff) and dinoflagellate cyst changes (lower surface water salinity) at and following the CIE onset in 22/10a-4 (Fig. 9).  The gradual lowering of surface water salinity and increase in the C/N ratio from 4m before the CIE onset at 22/10a-4 (above 2618m, Fig. 9), therefore, may also be the result of further uplift and restriction of the North Sea Basin, bringing the coastline and transported terrestrial material into closer proximity to the centrally-located 22/10a-4, although there is no documented sea level fall in the North Sea preceding the CIE (Knox, 1996; Powell et al., 1996).  Despite the limitations of this method, the large variation in the %low salinity dinoflagellate cysts (ranging from 0% to 80%) clearly indicates that significant environmental changes in surface water conditions occurred during the CIE onset in the central North Sea, and is supported by coeval changes in the sedimentary carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio (Fig. 10) which reflects changes in the proportion of terrestrial/marine organic material deposited in the North Sea Basin due to terrestrial runoff and productivity (see Section 4.4).  The Paleocene-Eocene marker event Apectodinium augustum (Bujak and Brinkhuis, 1998) occurs in 22/10a-4 at 2617.35m (Fig. 3), approximately at the CIE onset (as was found at 30/14-1, Fig. 1, Sluijs et al., 2007).  Since dinoflagellate cysts indicate increased halocline stratification of the North Sea at the CIE (Fig. 9d), and C/N ratios indicate a greater proportion of terrestrial carbon (Fig. 9c), it seems likely that the large reduction in I. hiatus in 22/10a-4 reflects a change in vegetation cover in the source region rather than simply a general reduction in the supply of pollen due to proximity of the coast.  Five samples from below the CIE at 2619.60, 2617.35, 2617.44, 2614.73, and 2614.71m (indicated in Fig. 5) contain Apectodinium, in contrast to the other samples below the CIE (Figs.  Palynological evidence from Arctic Spitsbergen (Harding et al., 2011) and New Zealand (Crouch et al., 2003a) suggests increased terrestrial runoff occurred at the onset of the CIE which may be related to hydrologic changes, and massive Pyrenees conglomerate deposits have been interpreted as the result of an abrupt increase in extreme precipitation within the early CIE (Schmitz and Pujalte, 2007).  C/N values broadly follow %low salinity dinoflagellate cysts (Fig. 9), with an increase at the Lista/Sele Formation boundary, 4m before the onset of the CIE and within the early CIE.  Alternatively, an increase in regional precipitation could have caused elevated terrestrial runoff (C/N ratios, kaolinite) and lower surface water salinity above 2618m before the CIE onset (Fig. 9).  Whilst neotropical vegetation in Central America appears to have responded to warming during the PETM with increased diversity and origination rates (Jaramillo et al., 2010), central North America experienced a rapid migration of plant communities associated with lower precipitation at the onset of the CIE (Wing et al., 2005), and southern England may have experienced a major change in plant composition due to changes in local fire-regime (Collinson et al., 2009).  A change to a dominance of angiosperm over gymnosperm pollen at the CIE onset has previously been recorded in the Arctic (Sluijs et al., 2006) and Wyoming (Smith et al., 2007).  Evidence for the linkage of the North Sea, Kilda and Arctic Basins comes from the coincident onset of A. augustum and laminated sediments at the CIE onset in sections from the North Sea (this study), Spitsbergen (Harding et al., 2011), and Lomonosov Ridge (Sluijs et al., 2006).  Our results provide the first evidence that the North Sea became stratified from 103 yrs before the CIE onset (above 2618m, Fig. 9).  Sea level rise at the CIE onset was also recorded in Arctic Spitsbergen (Harding et al., 2011).  Some of these samples (2619.60, 2614.73, and 2614.71m) also contain negative δ13CTOC, indicative of the CIE (Fig. 3).\n",
      "Environmental changes associated with the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM, ∼56Ma) have not yet been documented in detail from the North Sea Basin.  Located within proximity to the North Atlantic igneous province (NAIP), the Kilda Basin, and the northern rain belt (paleolatitude 54°N) during the PETM, this is a critical region for testing proposed triggers of atmospheric carbon release that may have caused the global negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) in marine and terrestrial environments.  The CIE onset is identified from organic matter δ13C in exceptional detail within a highly expanded sedimentary sequence.  Pollen and spore assemblages analysed in the same samples for the first time allow a reconstruction of possible changes to vegetation on the surrounding landmass.  Multiproxy palynological, geochemical, and sedimentologic records demonstrate enhanced halocline stratification and terrigenous deposition well before (103yrs) the CIE, interpreted as due to either tectonic uplift possibly from a nearby magmatic intrusion, or increased precipitation and fluvial runoff possibly from an enhanced hydrologic cycle.  Stratification and terrigenous deposition increased further at the onset and within the earliest CIE which, coupled with evidence for sea level rise, may be interpreted as resulting from an increase in precipitation over NW Europe consistent with an enhanced hydrologic cycle in response to global warming during the PETM.  Palynological evidence indicates a flora dominated by pollen from coastal swamp conifers before the CIE was abruptly replaced with a more diverse assemblage of generalist species including pollen similar to modern alder, fern, and fungal spores.  This may have resulted from flooding of coastal areas due to relative sea level rise, and/or ecologic changes forced by climate.  A shift towards more diverse angiosperm and pteridophyte vegetation within the early CIE, including pollen similar to modern hickory, documents a long term change to regional vegetation.  ► We identify the carbon isotope excursion from the North Sea in exceptional detail.  ► We document changes to ocean stratification well before atmospheric carbon release.  ► Precursor stratification may be associated with the trigger for carbon release.  ► Increased precipitation and runoff likely occurred along with carbon release.  ► We document a rapid change to regional vegetation during carbon release.\n",

      "Summary for Opening the gateways for diatoms primes Earth for Antarctic glaciation: Without Southern Ocean upwelling, or exchange between the Pacific and Atlantic basins, overturning circulation would have been sluggish (Cramer et al., 2009) trapping silicic acid and other nutrients in the deep ocean, limiting surface primary productivity and hence organic carbon burial via the biological pump.  Diatom δ30Si is a proxy for diatom silicic acid utilisation (Fig. 2a) because frustule growth preferentially incorporates 28Si over 30Si with 30ε∼-1.1‰ (De La Rocha et al., 1997).  Firstly, the rising silicic acid concentration in intermediate waters through the late Eocene, as indicated by sponge δ30Si decline (Fig. 6b), suggests the supply of silicic acid to the Southern Ocean surface is most likely to have increased across the period of diatom δ30Si rise.  This implies that once established, upwelling and diatom production, coupled with the deep regeneration cycle of biogenic opal, trapped silicic acid within a rather stable Southern Ocean \"loop\".  Through the late Eocene, between the beginning of our record at ∼38Ma and ∼33.2Ma, diatom δ30Si rose by ∼0.6‰ (Fig. 6c), equivalent to a doubling of silicic acid utilisation in the modern Southern Ocean (Fig. 2a).  Together, the diatom and sponge δ30Si records provide the first biogeochemical footprint of major late Eocene diatom expansion and proliferation to near modern levels by the Oi1 event in the Southern Ocean.  Silicic acid utilisation is determined by both diatom uptake (broadly reflecting diatom productivity) and silicic acid supply to the surface ocean.  Diatom production is characterised by high, rapid particle flux out of near surface waters, a process which enhances labile carbon concentration and organic carbon remineralisation in the deep ocean (Henson et al., 2012).  Affirming the link between diatom radiation and late Eocene pCO2 drawdown requires evidence that diatom diversification and opal deposition corresponded to increased diatom productivity and organic carbon burial.  Our new records of diatom and sponge δ30Si are shown in Fig. 6c and b (respectively) alongside benthic δ18O stacks for the main ocean basins (Fig. 6a) in which the 1-1.5‰ positive excursion centred around ∼33.7Ma marks the onset of Antarctic glaciation (data from Cramer et al., 2009).  Sponge δ30Si constitutes a proxy for bottom-water silicic acid concentration and ocean circulation (Fig. 2b) which can be used as a constraint on the concentration of silicic acid supplied to the surface ocean, facilitating resolution of the effects upon diatom δ30Si of diatom uptake and silicic acid supply.  Site 1090 is situated between the Sub-Antarctic and Sub-Tropical fronts (Gersonde et al., 1999) such that it underlies silicic acid depleted surface waters resulting from extensive diatom production along the northern pathway (Fig. 1 and 3b).  Cleaned sponge and diatom opal was dissolved via wet alkaline digestion (Cardinal et al., 2007; Ragueneau et al., 2005) in 0.2M NaOH at 100°C for 40min (diatoms) or up to 1 week (sponge spicules).  Increasing diatom δ30Si, interpreted in light of both opal accumulation rates and sponge δ30Si, provides the first biogeochemical evidence for diatom radiation during the late Eocene.  Several lines of evidence suggest that the late Eocene diatom δ30Si increase resulted from enhanced diatom uptake.\n",
      "The abrupt onset of Antarctic glaciation during the Eocene-Oligocene Transition (∼33.7Ma, Oi1) is linked to declining atmospheric pCO2 levels, yet the mechanisms that forced pCO2 decline remain elusive.  Biogenic silicon cycling is inextricably linked to both long and short term carbon cycling through the diatoms, siliceous walled autotrophs which today account for up to 40% of primary production.  It is hypothesised that during the Late Eocene a sharp rise in diatom abundance could have contributed to pCO2 drawdown and global cooling by increasing the proportion of organic carbon buried in marine sediment.  Diatom and sponge silicon isotope ratios (δ30Si) are here combined for the first time to reconstruct the late Eocene-early Oligocene ocean silicon cycle and provide new insight into the role of diatom productivity in Antarctic glaciation.  At ODP site 1090 in the Southern Ocean, a 0.6‰ rise in diatom δ30Si through the late Eocene documents increasing diatom silicic acid utilisation with high, near modern values attained by the earliest Oligocene.  A concomitant 1.5‰ decline in sponge δ30Si at ODP site 689 on the Maud Rise tracks an approximate doubling of intermediate depth silicic acid concentration in the high southern latitudes.  Intermediate depth silicic acid concentration peaked at ∼31.5Ma, coincident with the final establishment of a deepwater pathway through the Tasman Gateway and Drake Passage.  These results suggest that upwelling intensification related to the spin-up of a circum-Antarctic current may have driven late Eocene diatom proliferation.  Organic carbon burial associated with higher diatom abundance and export provides a mechanism that can account for pCO2 drawdown not only at, but also prior to, Antarctic glaciation as required by a pCO2 'threshold' mechanism for ice sheet growth.  Diatom and sponge δ30Si used to reconstruct the Eocene-Oligocene silicon cycle.  0.6‰ late Eocene rise in diatom δ30Si (increasing silicic acid utilisation).  1.5‰ late Eocene/early Oligocene sponge δ30Si fall (increasing silicic acid concentration).  Upwelling related to proto-ACC facilitated late Eocene diatom proliferation.  Diatom driven carbon burial contributed to pCO2 decline before Antarctic glaciation.\n",

      "Summary for Marine 187Os/188Os isotope stratigraphy reveals the interaction of volcanism and ocean circulation during Oceanic Anoxic Event 2: The Osi data also show that a major pulse of volcanism interpreted to be associated with activity from Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs), i.e., Caribbean and High Arctic (Fig. 1; Snow et al., 2005; Tegner et al., 2011) occurred at or just prior to the onset of OAE 2.  The Osi values in this study were determined from Re-Os data and the 187Re decay constant (1.666e-11a-1; Smoliar et al., 1996; Supplementary Material, Table 2a-f) using the CTB age of 93.90 Ma that was determined from astrochronologic interpolation between volcanic ash ages (based on both 40Ar/39Ar and 206Pb/238U determinations; Gradstein et al., 2012; Meyers et al., 2012a).  The onset of OAE 2 is identified by an abrupt 2-3‰ VPDB δ13Corg positive shift from values of ∼-27‰ in the upper Hartland Shale, 4.3 m below the CTB (Fig. 2; Supplementary Material, Table 1a; Sageman et al., 2006).  During the emplacement of the LIP we assume that growth of the plateau does not continue to affect the Os isotope composition (Robinson et al., 2009), since the Osi values are homogeneous (∼0.2; Fig. 3).  The Osi stratigraphic profiles across the CTB in this study are from (Fig. 1): the Portland #1 core, which is representative of the Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) near Pueblo, Colorado (Western Interior Seaway (WIS); Kennedy et al., 2000); the Wunstorf core in Germany, a representative section in the NW European pelagic shelf sea (Voigt et al., 2008); the Vocontian Basin, south east France (Western Tethys; Grosheny et al., 2006; Jarvis et al., 2011); and DSDP Site 530 (proto-South Atlantic; Forster et al., 2008).  In contrast to the elevated radiogenic Osi values just before 'A' at Portland, the Osi values of Site 1260, Vocontian Basin, Furlo and Site 530 show a progressive trend to unradiogenic Osi values (0.75 to 0.55) over ∼155 kyr (Fig. 3) suggesting that hydrothermal input dominated Os chemistry in the open oceans.  Based on the GSSP time scale, and confirmed by additional estimates from different OAE 2 sites, the duration of the C isotope excursion that characterizes the OAE 2 is between 500-600 kyr (Meyers et al., 2012b).  Based on the trend to unradiogenic Osi values at Site 1260, Vocontian Basin, Furlo and Site 530 we suggest that the initiation of volcanism was at least ∼200 kyr prior to 'A' (∼94.58 Ma; Fig. 3, CLIP i), with the major pulse of submarine volcanism happening at ∼-30 kyr (94.41 Ma; Fig. 3, CLIP ii), where all locations possess near mantle-like Osi values.  At Portland the Osi values show some distinct fluctuations prior to the onset of OAE 2 (point 'A' on the δ13Corg curve).  Across the onset of OAE 2 there is a dramatic shift to very high values in Os isotope concentration.  From 'A' through to the lower Turonian, the Osi profiles and values are very similar across Portland, Furlo, Site 530 and Wunstorf, progressively trending from unradiogenic (∼0.2) to radiogenic values (∼0.6 to 0.7; Fig. 3) within ∼350 kyr.  Furthermore, our interpretation of the Osi profile concurs with the hypothesis of increased ocean circulation based on analysis of neodymium (Nd) isotopes (Martin et al., 2012; Zheng et al., 2013).  Osi values return to ∼0.3 at 'B' comparable to other sections (Fig. 3).\n",
      "High-resolution osmium (Os) isotope stratigraphy across the Cenomanian-Turonian Boundary Interval from 6 sections for four transcontinental settings has produced a record of seawater chemistry that demonstrates regional variability as a function of terrestrial and hydrothermal inputs, revealing the impact of palaeoenvironmental processes.  In every section the 187Os/188Os profiles show a comparable trend; radiogenic values in the lead up to Oceanic Anoxic Event 2 (OAE 2); an abrupt unradiogenic trend at the onset of OAE 2; an unradiogenic interval during the first part of OAE 2; and a return to radiogenic values towards the end of the event, above the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary.  The unradiogenic trend in 187Os/188Os is synchronous in all sections.  Previous work suggests that activity of the Caribbean LIP (Large Igneous Province) was the source of unradiogenic Os across the OAE 2 and possibly an instigator of anoxia in the oceans.  Here we assess this hypothesis and consider the influence of activity from other LIPs; such as the High Arctic LIP.  A brief shift to high radiogenic 187Os/188Os values occurred in the Western Interior Seaway before the onset of OAE 2.  We evaluate this trend and suggest that a combination of factors collectively played critical roles in the initiation of OAE 2; differential input of nutrients from continental and volcanogenic sources, coupled with efficient palaeocirculation of the global ocean and epeiric seas, enhanced productivity due to higher nutrient availability, which permitted penecontemporaneous transport of continental and LIP-derived nutrients to trans-equatorial basins.  Use Osi isotope stratigraphy to infer driving mechanism(s) of Oceanic Anoxic Event 2.  Osi profiles from 6 sites illustrate the regional variability of seawater chemistry.  δ13Corg and Osi records combined generate an integrated timescale model based on the GSSP.  Anoxia is a function of feedback based on climate change and volcanism.  Quantitatively constrain the duration of volcanism from Caribbean LIP.\n",

      "Summary for Minor and trace element emissions from post-combustion CO2 capture from coal: Experimental and equilibrium calculations: The literature suggests that limestone can be used to capture Ni, Pb and Cd, thus accounting for the increased concentration of these three elements with increasing bed inventory [30].  Fig. 12 shows that increasing SO2 concentration does influence trace element sorbent concentration, and for B in particular, concentrations rose from 2ppm to 2.6ppm for 0 and 1000ppm SO2 respectively.  Overall, although concentrations in the flue gas are small at <2ppm, increasing bed inventory does appear to increase the concentration of the majority of major elements present in the flue gas.  The results show that looping cycle tests carried out in the presence of increasing concentrations of SO2 resulted in, for the most part, a decrease in elemental concentrations in both solid sorbent and flue gas samples.  The mass balances however show that compared to the concentration of elements in the sorbent, the concentrations partitioning to the gaseous phase is very low.  Fig. 6 shows the concentrations of minor elements in the solid sorbent, where increasing bed inventory resulted in increasing values observed for Co, Ni, Cu, Mo, Cd, and Sn.  In this case, major elements are defined as those of concentration >10ppm, minor elements are of concentration between 1 and 10ppm, and trace elements are of concentration <1ppm.  However, all elements included within Fig. 5 can be considered to be at very low concentrations of <2ppm.  Elements that have low volatility are most likely to partition to solid phases within the reactor, and therefore it would be expected that the concentration of the low volatility elements would increase for a greater bed inventory.  Due to extended calculation times required, a sensitivity analysis was carried out firstly for nine trace elements (Ba, Cd, Cr, K, Mg, Ni, Sr, Ti, and Zn) and then for twenty-one trace elements (Li, Be, Mg, Al, K, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, As, Se, Sr, Cd, Sb, Ba, Hg, and Pb), in addition to the four 'base' elements (Ca, C, O, and H) (always considered to be present from limestone and gas input), based on those which are considered to be most volatile, have the greatest negative impact on the environment and health, and which were present in the highest quantities in the limestone as identified by ICP-MS analysis, as outlined in Table 2.\n",

Thermodynamic equilibrium modelling undertaken to support experimental work.  Elemental partitioning, including gaseous elemental emissions from pilot scale (25kWth), post combustion CO2 capture using a Ca-based sorbent, have been investigated for naturally occurring elemental impurities found in limestone, that have the potential to be released to the environment under carbonation and calcination conditions.  Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis of Longcliffe SP52 limestone was undertaken to identify other impurities present, and the effect of sorbent mass and SO2 concentration on elemental partitioning in the carbonator between solid sorbent and gaseous phase was investigated, using a bubbler sampling system.  Samples were analysed using ICP-MS, which showed that sorbent mass and SO2 concentration in the carbonator effected the concentrations of gaseous trace elements sampled.  Thermodynamic modelling of the carbonation and calcination process was also undertaken, based on molar quantities of trace elements identified from ICP-MS analysis of limestone, which provided useful information with regards to element stability and partitioning under realistic CO2 capture conditions.\n",

      "Summary for The Cassini Enceladus encounters 2005-2010 in the view of energetic electron measurements: The electron measurements obtained by the MIMI/LEMMS in the energy range between 15keV and several MeV onboard Cassini showed that the drift and bounce motion of the electrons perpendicular and along the B→×∇B→lines cause drop-out signatures in the distribution of electrons by the moon itself and by any material in the environment around the moon.  If the energy of the measured electrons is lower than the resonant energy for a given orbital distance from the planet an absorption feature should be observed only downstream of the moon as described above while the bite-out in the high-energy channels should only be observed upstream of the moon.  The 14 flybys of Cassini at the moon Enceladus shed new light on the interaction of material released from the moon and the magnetosphere.  An overview of the electron measurements from the MIMI/LEMMS instrument in the vicinity of Enceladus for the flybys E0, E12, and E13 is shown in Fig. 2.  Fig. 3 shows the trajectory of Cassini during the flybys E0, E12, and E13 close to the moon inside of 10 Enceladus radii REnc.  The energetic electron intensities measured during the high-latitude flybys at Enceladus are summarized in Fig. 8.  Energetic electrons observed by the MIMI/LEMMS sensor bounce along the field lines and drift perpendicular to B→×∇B→, which, away from Enceladus, is along Enceladus' orbit.  The responses of energetic electrons inside the MIMI/LEMMS instrument during the equatorial south flybys are summarized in Fig. 5.  Clearly visible is a lack of electrons in this channel in the vicinity of the moon.  The interaction between energetic electrons and the moon essentially is given by the individual motion of the particles.  Therefore any absorption signature related to the moon upstream is caused by high-energy electrons.  If they encounter a moon or any other dense material like a plume, they get absorbed (whole or partially) and leave a dropout signature in the electron intensities (except at the previously mentioned resonance energy where the drift motion of the electron and the orbital motion of the moon are the same and no absorption is expected).  At the orbit of Enceladus the resonance energy is at about 1MeV for 90° equatorial pitch angle and about 1.3MeV for electrons with 30° pitch angle (Roussos et al., 2007) assuming full corotation at the distance of the moon.  The bite-out signature is seen in all channels upstream of the moon indicating that high-energy electrons with energies greater than the resonance energy are lost at the moon while drifting upstream.  MIMI/LEMMS is able to measure the intensities, energy spectra, and pitch angle distributions of energetic charged ions and electrons separately in the energy range between about 20keV and several tens of MeV.  All electrons within that flux tube are absorbed by the moon.\n",
      "► Ramp-like features in electron intensities in the low-energy channels.  ► High-energy depletions upstream for electrons with energies above the resonant energy.  ► \"Dust\"-related peaks in the electron data correlated with data from other instrument onboard Cassini.  The moon Enceladus, embedded in Saturn's radiation belts, is the main internal source of neutral and charged particles in the Kronian magnetosphere.  A plume of water ice molecules and dust released through geysers on the south polar region provides enough material to feed the E-ring and also the neutral torus of Saturn and the entire magnetosphere.  In the time period 2005-2010 the Cassini spacecraft flew close by the moon 14 times, sometimes as low as 25km above the surface and directly through the plume.  For the very first time measurements of plasma and energetic particles inside the plume and its immediate vicinity could be obtained.  In this work we summarize the results of energetic electron measurements in the energy range 27keV to 21MeV taken by the Low Energy Magnetospheric Measurement System (LEMMS), part of the Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument (MIMI) onboard Cassini in the vicinity of the moon in combination with measurements of the magnetometer instrument MAG and the Electron Spectrometer ELS of the plasma instrument CAPS onboard the spacecraft.  Features in the data can be interpreted as that the spacecraft was connected to the plume material along field lines well before entering the high density region of the plume.  Sharp absorption signatures as the result of losses of energetic electrons bouncing along those field lines, through the emitted gas and dust clouds, clearly depend on flyby geometry as well as on measured pitch angle/look direction of the instrument.  We found that the depletion signatures during some of the flybys show \"ramp-like\" features where only a partial depletion has been observed further away from the moon followed by nearly full absorption of electrons closer in.  We interpret this as partially/fully connected to the flux tube connecting the moon with Cassini.  During at least two of the flybys (with some evidence of one additional encounter) MIMI/LEMMS data are consistent with the presence of dust in energetic electron data when Cassini flew directly through the south polar plume.  In addition we found gradients in the magnetic field components which are frequently found to be associated with changes in the MIMI/LEMMS particles intensities.  This indicates that complex electron drifts in the vicinity of Enceladus could form forbidden regions for electrons which may appear as intensity drop-outs.\n",

      "Summary for Episodic bright and dark spots on Uranus: In the 25 December image, we again found a small dark spot and a bright eastward companion cloud close to the predicted location of BS2, but this time the companion feature is quite bright in the FQ889N image, indicating cloud particles had at this time reached pressures significantly lower (i.e. at altitudes significantly higher) than the methane condensation level.  The main feature visible in the 25 December image is a small dark spot accompanied by a bright companion cloud.  From Fig. 12 it can be inferred that this feature would also have been visible in K′ images, had any been taken at the time.  BS1 began to decline in brightness between October 26 and November 10, and was not clearly identifiable after 16 December, though subtle features were found that are consistent with survival through our last image on 29 December 2011, in which BS1 appears just north of a faint dark spot visible in F845M images, and has much more contrast in the F889N image taken on that date.  These images (Fig. 2A and B) revealed that the cloud feature had brightened and impelled us to further investigation.  The dark spot is visible in F845M and F775W images and the companion cloud is visible in these images and also with greater contrast in FQ889N and FQ906N images, implying that the bright cloud is elevated well above the methane condensation level.  We did not become aware of the second bright spot (BS2) until we saw the 10 November image (Fig. 4P).  It would also not have been seen in a WFC3 FQ889N image, had there been one taken on 11 November, while BS1 would have been seen in such images.  When first identified in the 26 October 2011 Gemini-North image (Fig. 4F), the bright spot (BS1) appeared as a relatively compact feature with two adjacent components.  As evident in Fig. 18, there was no indication of a dark spot in F658N images.  BS2 was identifiable in 20 and 29 December TOO images, and in the 25 December image the feature seen may be either BS2 or the result of merging of BS1 and BS2.  Companion clouds related to this dark spot were also seen in H images obtained with the Keck II telescope NIRC2 Narrow Angle (NA) camera (Fig. 1C), though they were not unusually bright in these images.  On 26 October 2011, Gemini images of Uranus revealed another unusually bright cloud feature (Fig. 2C), providing us with another possible opportunity to study this episodic development.  The F845M image in panel M also registers that bright feature and also a faint dark spot just below it.  There we see that K′ and FQ889N images will not reveal any cloud features deeper than about 1bar.\n",
      "► A spot of high and increasing brightness was discovered on Uranus on 26 October 2011.  ► This 24°N spot was found about 500 mb above the 1.2bar methane condensation level.  ► A second and 500mb deeper brightspot was discovered just 2°N of the first.  ► Their different drift rates measured from July to Dec led to many close approaches.  ► Hubble imaging revealed a rare dark spot near their 25 December 2011 close approach.  The northern mid-latitudes of Uranus produce greater episodes of bright cloud formation than any other region on the planet.  Near 30°N, very bright cloud features were observed in 1999, 2004, and 2005, with lifetimes of the order of months.  In October 2011, Gemini and HST observations revealed another unusually bright cloud feature near 23°N, which was subsequently identified in July 2011 observations and found to be increasing in brightness.  Observations obtained at Keck in November 2011 revealed a second bright spot only 2°N of the first, but with a substantially different drift rate (-9.2°E/day vs -1.4°E/day), which we later determined would lead to a close approach on 25 December 2011.  A Hubble Target of Opportunity proposal was activated to image the results of the interaction.  We found that the original bright spot had faded dramatically before the HST observations had begun and the second bright spot was found to be a companion of a new dark spot on Uranus, only the second ever observed.  Both spots exhibited variable drift rates during the nearly 5months of tracking, and both varied in brightness, with BS1 reaching its observed peak on 26 October 2011, and BS2 on 11 November 2011.  Altitude measurements based on near-IR imaging in H and Hcont filters showed that the deeper BS2 clouds were located near the methane condensation level (≈1.2bars), while BS1 was generally ∼500mb above that level (at lower pressures).  Large morphological changes in the bright cloud features suggest that they are companion clouds of possibly orographic nature associated with vortex circulations, perhaps similar to companion clouds associated with the Great Dark Spot on Neptune, but in this case at a much smaller size scale, spanning only a few degrees of longitude at their greatest extents.\n",

      "Summary for Energetic electron observations of Rhea's magnetospheric interaction: The width of Rhea's wake tends to increase with increasing electron energy.  As in R1, the wake becomes broader with increasing electron energy.  These dropouts are near the wake flanks, although in some cases (R3) they can be observed also than 5RRh far from Rhea.  R3 is the only flyby so far where electron densities show dropout signatures across both wake boundaries.  The cold electron density from RPWS does not show a wake signature, although densities are much more variable within the wake boundaries compared to R1.  In none of these flybys, however, do the plasma density measurements show the anticipated dropout at the wake.  We also stress that the energetic electron wake has a significantly different structure to that of a cold plasma wake.  The wake is also visible in the higher energy channels C6 and E2 (third panel).  Furthermore, the magnitude of the associated change in ∣B∣ is similar to the one observed in Rhea's wake.  This makes the lack of a wake signature in electron density even more puzzling.  The corotational wake is again evident as a region with a large dropout in electron fluxes.  The most interesting observation concerns the simultaneous presence of narrow dropouts in energetic electron fluxes, visible usually near the wake flanks with narrow flux enhancements within the wake boundaries.  At the wake center, a sharp density increase is also visible.  Here, the geometrical/corotational wake is defined on the basis of where energetic electron absorption may be observed.  The first close downstream flyby on November 26, 2005 (termed R1), revealed broad energetic electron (20-100keV) flux dropouts extending almost 7-8 Rhea radii (RRh) on each side of Rhea's wake.  These features are usually visible closer to the wake.  The wake broadens at higher energies, as seen in all other flybys.  The instability is probably driven by pressure and magnetic field gradients in the wake.  Pressure gradient (diamagnetic) currents flowing along the wake boundaries or within the wake lead to a compression of the magnetic field, B, behind the moon.  Small scale dropouts appear on the side of the wake (red arrows).  From the overview of the four flyby observations given in Section 4, we can understand that Rhea's interaction region has many complex features in the energetic particle, plasma density and the magnetic field datasets.  A broad flux dropout is seen only after Cassini exits the wake.  The presence of an exosphere can therefore not explain the observations of ambient plasma density levels in Rhea's wake.\n",
      "► We give a detailed review of an energetic electron dataset in a lunar-type interaction.  ► A local transport process occurs in the wake of Rhea.  ► The transport is associated to a flute type of instability driven by pressure gradients.  ► We show that surface charging is an important element of the interaction.  Saturn's moon Rhea is thought to be a simple plasma absorber, however, energetic particle observations in its vicinity show a variety of unexpected and complex interaction features that do not conform with our current understanding about plasma absorbing interactions.  Energetic electron data are especially interesting, as they contain a series of broad and narrow flux depletions on either side of the moon's wake.  The association of these dropouts with absorption by dust and boulders orbiting within Rhea's Hill sphere was suggested but subsequently not confirmed, so in this study we review data from all four Cassini flybys of Rhea to date seeking evidence for alternative processes operating within the moon's interaction region.  We focus on energetic electron observations, which we put in context with magnetometer, cold plasma density and energetic ion data.  All flybys have unique features, but here we only focus on several structures that are consistently observed.  The most interesting common feature is that of narrow dropouts in energetic electron fluxes, visible near the wake flanks.  These are typically seen together with narrow flux enhancements inside the wake.  A phase-space-density analysis for these structures from the first Rhea flyby (R1) shows that Liouville's theorem holds, suggesting that they may be forming due to rapid transport of energetic electrons from the magnetosphere to the wake, through narrow channels.  A series of possibilities are considered to explain this transport process.  We examined whether complex energetic electron drifts in the interaction region of a plasma absorbing moon (modeled through a hybrid simulation code) may allow such a transport.  With the exception of several features (e.g. broadening of the central wake with increasing electron energy), most of the commonly observed interaction signatures in energetic electrons (including the narrow structures) were not reproduced.  Additional dynamical processes, not simulated by the hybrid code, should be considered in order to explain the data.  For the small scale features, the possibility that a flute (interchange) instability acts on the electrons is discussed.  This instability is probably driven by strong gradients in the plasma pressure and the magnetic field magnitude: magnetometer observations show clearly signatures consistent with the (expected) plasma pressure loss due to ion absorption at Rhea.  Another potential driver of the instability could have been gradients in the cold plasma density, which are, however, surprisingly absent from most crossings of Rhea's plasma wake.  The lack of a density depletion in Rhea's wake suggests the presence of a local cold plasma source region.  Hybrid plasma simulations show that this source cannot be the ionized component of Rhea's weak exosphere.  It is probably related to accelerated photoelectrons from the moon's negatively charged surface, indicating that surface charging may play a very important role in shaping Rhea's magnetospheric interaction region.\n",

      "Summary for Magnetosphere-atmosphere coupling at Saturn: 1 - Response of thermosphere and ionosphere to steady state polar forcing: Diurnally-averaged temperatures at the peak ionospheric density level (10-5mbar) and latitude 78° from simulations R1-R18 (Table 1) are shown in the upper panel of Fig. 12 as a function of 10keV electron energy flux and peak electric field strength.  Using a radial profile of magnetospheric plasma velocities inferred from Voyager plasma observations and assuming fixed ionospheric conductances of 1mho, Cowley et al. (2004) calculated the associated field aligned currents and resulting ionospheric Joule heating rates of around 2.5TW per hemisphere, considerably larger than energy from the direct precipitation of electrons (globally ⩽0.06TW) and solar EUV heating (globally 0.15-0.27TW) (Müller-Wodarg et al., 2006).  High latitude temperatures in Saturn's upper atmosphere published until recently had values below ∼460K (Melin et al., 2007; Vervack and Moses, 2012), but Melin et al. (2011) and Stallard et al. (2012) have shown that H3+ emission may be brighter than previously indicated, and temperatures hotter.  Moore et al. (2006) presented a comparison of calculated ionospheric densities with low latitude Cassini RSS observations (Nagy et al., 2006) and concluded that the observed dawn-dusk asymmetry in the ionosphere at low latitudes was best reproduced by the model when imposing an external influx of neutral water molecules into the low- to mid-latitude upper atmosphere at a rate of (0.5-1.0)×107cm-2s-1.  Using a global model of Saturn's coupled thermosphere and ionosphere (Moore et al., 2004, 2010; Müller-Wodarg et al., 2006; Galand et al., 2009, 2011), we self-consistently calculate for the first time the response of the coupled thermosphere-ionosphere system to a range of values for energetic particle precipitation flux and high latitude electric fields.  The bottom panel of Fig. 12 shows as a function of 10keV electron energy flux and peak electric field strength the column emission rates of H3+ calculated from the vertical profiles of H3+ densities and temperatures of simulations R1-R18.  In simulating the response of Saturn's coupled thermosphere-ionosphere system to magnetospheric forcing, we varied two key parameters in the model, namely, the energy flux of precipitating auroral 10keV electrons and the auroral electric field strength.  Fig. 5 shows the peak electron densities in Saturn's ionosphere as a function of latitude.  This is related to Saturn's fast rotation rate and the sub-corotation of the auroral thermosphere, which ultimately generates a meridional wind transporting energy from equator to pole in the deep atmosphere, thus cooling down the equatorial regions (Smith et al., 2007).  A magnetospheric electric field of ∼100mVm-1 mapped into the ionosphere would in combination with at 10keV electron flux of 1mWm-2 generate thermosphere temperatures of ∼800K, well in excess of observed values.  As can be inferred from Fig. 10, auroral (magnetospheric) energy is transported by meridional winds primarily into the polar cap region, explaining the temperature maximum there (Fig. 6).  Our simulations originate from two codes developed side-by-side but separately, namely, the Saturn Thermosphere GCM (Müller-Wodarg et al., 2006) and Saturn 1-D Ionosphere Model (Moore et al., 2004) which were subsequently fully coupled to form the Saturn Thermosphere Ionosphere Model (STIM).  According to the simulations of our study magnetospheric energy cannot explain the observed thermospheric temperatures at low and mid latitudes.\n",
      "► We self-consistently calculate Saturn magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere coupling.  ► Magnetospheric energy controls flow of mass and energy in Saturn's thermosphere.  ► Thermospheric dynamics are key to understanding high latitude energy balance.  ► H3+ observations combined with our simulations may constrain H2 (v⩾4) abundances.  We present comprehensive calculations of the steady state response of Saturn's coupled thermosphere-ionosphere to forcing by solar radiation, magnetospheric energetic electron precipitation and high latitude electric fields caused by sub-corotation of magnetospheric plasma.  Significant additions to the physical processes calculated in our Saturn Thermosphere Ionosphere General Circulation Model (STIM-GCM) include the comprehensive and self-consistent treatment of neutral-ion dynamical coupling and the use of self-consistently calculated rates of plasma production from incident energetic electrons.  Our simulations successfully reproduce the observed high latitude temperatures as well as the latitudinal variations of ionospheric peak electron densities that have been observed by the Cassini Radio Science Subsystem experiment (RSS).  We find magnetospheric energy deposition to strongly control the flow of mass and energy in the high and mid-latitude thermosphere and thermospheric dynamics to play a crucial role in driving this flow, highlighting the importance of including dynamics in any high latitude energy balance studies on Saturn and other Gas Giants.  By relating observed H3+ column emissions and temperatures to the same quantities inferred from simulated atmosphere profiles we identify a potential method of better constraining the still unknown abundance of vibrationally excited H2 which strongly affects the H3+ densities.  Our calculations also suggest that local time variability in H3+ column emission flux may be largely driven by local time changes of H3+ densities rather than temperatures.  By exploring the parameter space of possible high latitude electric field strengths and incident energetic electron fluxes, we determine the response of thermospheric polar temperatures to a range of these magnetospheric forcing parameters, illustrating that 10keV electron fluxes of 0.1-1.2mWm-2 in combination with electric field strengths of 80-100mVm-1 produce H3+ emissions consistent with observations.  Our calculations highlight the importance of considering thermospheric temperatures as one of the constraints when examining the state of Saturn's magnetosphere and its coupling to the upper atmosphere.\n",

      "Summary for The escape of heavy atoms from the ionosphere of HD209458b.: In order to calculate predicted transits in the C II and Si III lines, we created model emission line profiles for HD209458 based on SUMER observations of the Sun (Curdt et al., 2001) adjusted to the observations of HD209458 (Linsky et al., 2010).  Their model line profiles were also constrained by the high resolution STIS E140M observations of Vidal-Madjar et al. (2003) that resolve the components, although this data has low S/N and it was not used for transit observations.  This value agrees with the observations to within 1σ (Vidal-Madjar et al., 2004; Ben-Jaffel and Hosseini, 2010), but it is smaller than the transit depth of 6.6% predicted by the M7 model.  The line-integrated transit depth based on this model is 5.8%, which is still higher than the transit depth based on the C2 model.  We note that the transit in the Si III line was not detected earlier by Vidal-Madjar et al. (2004).  The observations indicate that the transit depths based on the C2 model fall short of the observed values because the model underestimates the width of the absorption lines.  This in turn means that p0=0.4μbar i.e., close to the lower boundary of the M7 model (here the agreement with the M7 model is obviously not exact because the transit depths in K10 are based on a complete forward model of the observed transit within the whole line profile).  This model is described in detail by Koskinen et al. (2012) (hereafter, Paper I).  In this section we constrain the temperature and composition of the upper atmosphere of HD209458b through a combined analysis of transit observations in the FUV emission lines.  The transit depths predicted by the M7 model are higher partly because the mean temperature of 8250K is higher than the corresponding temperature in the C2 model (Paper I).  However, Ben-Jaffel and Hosseini (2010) fitted the H Lyman α observations by scaling the density profiles from the model of Garcia Munoz (2007), and argued that suprathermal O and C+ are required to fit the transit depths in the O I and C II lines.  Based on the observed transits in the Na D lines, Charbonneau et al. (2002) argued that Na is depleted in the atmosphere because their cloudless solar composition model predicted significantly deeper absorption in the D lines.  We also used results from a state-of-the-art photochemical model (Lavvas et al., in preparation) to constrain the density profiles of the observed species in the lower atmosphere.  This value agrees well with the O I transit depth based on the C2 model (see Table 2).  They fitted both the line-integrated transit depth based on the low resolution G140L data (Vidal-Madjar et al., 2004; Ben-Jaffel and Hosseini, 2010), and the transit depths and light curve based on the medium resolution G140M data (Vidal-Madjar et al., 2003; Ben-Jaffel, 2007, 2008) (see Figs.  This model agrees to better than 1σ with all of the observed transit depths apart from the O I and C II 1334.5Å lines (see Fig. 7 and Table 2).  With solar abundances, the same models that agree with the H Lyman α transit observations tend to underestimate the transit depths in the C II and Si III lines.  Fig. 5 shows the line-integrated transit depth within the H Lyman α line profile as a function of the cutoff level for the C2 model.  However, different solar observations point to approximately 40% limb brightening in the 1335.7Å line and probably a similar variation in the 1334.5Å line, with the intensity rising steadily at μ>0.6 (Lites et al., 1978; Judge et al., 2003).\n",
      "► We compare UV transits of HD209458b with empirical and hydrodynamic models.  ► We constrain the mean temperature, densities and escape rates of different species.  ► The detection of atomic oxygen implies a minimum mass loss rate of 6×106kgs-1.  ► The results constrain the temperature, chemistry, and ionization of the atmosphere.  ► Detection of Si2+ indicates that clouds of forsterite and enstatite do not form.  Transits in the H I 1216Å (Lyman α), O I 1334Å, C II 1335Å, and Si III 1206.5Å lines constrain the properties of the upper atmosphere of HD209458b.  In addition to probing the temperature and density profiles in the thermosphere, they have implications for the properties of the lower atmosphere.  Fits to the observations with a simple empirical model and a direct comparison with a more complex hydrodynamic model constrain the mean temperature and ionization state of the atmosphere, and imply that the optical depth of the extended thermosphere of the planet in the atomic resonance lines is significant.  In particular, it is sufficient to explain the observed transit depths in the H I 1216Å line.  The detection of O at high altitudes implies that the minimum mass loss rate from the planet is approximately 6×106kgs-1.  The mass loss rate based on our hydrodynamic model is higher than this and implies that diffusive separation is prevented for neutral species with a mass lower than about 130amu by the escape of H.  Heavy ions are transported to the upper atmosphere by Coulomb collisions with H+ and their presence does not provide as strong constraints on the mass loss rate as the detection of heavy neutral atoms.  Models of the upper atmosphere with solar composition and heating based on the average solar X-ray and EUV flux agree broadly with the observations but tend to underestimate the transit depths in the O I, C II, and Si III lines.  This suggests that the temperature and/or elemental abundances in the thermosphere may be higher than expected from such models.  Observations of the escaping atmosphere can potentially be used to constrain the strength of the planetary magnetic field.  We find that a magnetic moment of m≲0.04mJ, where mJ is the jovian magnetic moment, allows the ions to escape globally rather than only along open field lines.  The detection of Si2+ in the thermosphere indicates that clouds of forsterite and enstatite do not form in the lower atmosphere.  This has implications for the temperature and dynamics of the atmosphere that also affect the interpretation of transit and secondary eclipse observations in the visible and infrared wavelengths.\n",

      "Summary for The escape of heavy atoms from the ionosphere of HD209458b.: Koskinen et al. (2010a) inferred a mean temperature of 8250K in the thermosphere of HD209458b with p0=1μbar (the M7 model).  We used our model to calculate temperature and velocity profiles based on different heating efficiencies and stellar fluxes.  This is why the temperature at the 30nbar level in the C2 model is 3800K and not 1000K.  We calculated the temperature differences for H, H+, and electrons based on the C2 model.  The sonic point in the C1 model is below 11Rp, and it is in a region where stellar heating is significant.  All of these models are based on the outflow boundary conditions for temperature, velocity, and density.  The model also showed that stellar heating leads to temperatures of ∼10,000K in the upper atmosphere, and predicted an energy-limited mass loss rate of 4.7×107kgs-1 (Yelle, 2006).  Model C2 is otherwise similar to C1 but the heating efficiency varies with photoelectron energy and altitude (see below).  It is therefore useful to test the reaction of the model to different heating rates and profiles.  The mass loss rate based on the substellar atmosphere for this model is 2.8×107kgs-1, in good agreement with the Murray-Clay et al. (2009) results.  We highlight the effect of heating efficiency and stellar flux on the density and temperature profiles, and constrain the likely heating rates by using photoelectron heating efficiencies based on the results of Cecchi-Pestellini et al. (2009) and our own estimates (Section 3.1).  We discuss the general dependency of the temperature and velocity profiles on the net heating efficiency and stellar flux, and relate this discussion to new temperature and velocity profiles for HD209458b that are based on realistic photoelectron heating efficiencies calculated specifically for close-in EGPs.  In the H50 model the pressure averaged temperature is 7000K.  We used their heating efficiencies for xe=0.1 in the C2 model.  The volume averaged mean temperature below 15Rp in the C2 model is 3900K.  This explains the large range of temperature and density profiles predicted by earlier models that arise from different boundary conditions and assumptions about the stellar flux, radiative transfer, and heating efficiencies.  This criteria is consistent with the equations of motion, and it means that r0 that should be used to calculate X0 is above the upper boundary of our model because significant stellar heating persists at all altitudes.  It is also interesting that the temperature profiles in the models that are based on ηnet=0.5 and the solar flux enhanced by factors of 2-100 differ from models with the average solar flux and a higher heating efficiency.\n",
      "► We developed a new model to explain the FUV transit observations of HD209458b.  ► We find a qualitative agreement between the model and the observed atmosphere.  ► We constrain the mass loss rate and escape mechanism based on stellar heating.  ► We present density profiles for the detected heavy atoms and ions.  ► Diffusive separation of heavy species is prevented by the escape of H and protons.  The detections of atomic hydrogen, heavy atoms and ions surrounding the extrasolar giant planet (EGP) HD209458b constrain the composition, temperature and density profiles in its upper atmosphere.  Thus the observations provide guidance for models that have so far predicted a range of possible conditions.  We present the first hydrodynamic escape model for the upper atmosphere that includes all of the detected species in order to explain their presence at high altitudes, and to further constrain the temperature and velocity profiles.  This model calculates the stellar heating rates based on recent estimates of photoelectron heating efficiencies, and includes the photochemistry of heavy atoms and ions in addition to hydrogen and helium.  The composition at the lower boundary of the escape model is constrained by a full photochemical model of the lower atmosphere.  We confirm that molecules dissociate near the 1μbar level, and find that complex molecular chemistry does not need to be included above this level.  We also confirm that diffusive separation of the detected species does not occur because the heavy atoms and ions collide frequently with the rapidly escaping H and H+.  This means that the abundance of the heavy atoms and ions in the thermosphere simply depends on the elemental abundances and ionization rates.  We show that, as expected, H and O remain mostly neutral up to at least 3Rp, whereas both C and Si are mostly ionized at significantly lower altitudes.  We also explore the temperature and velocity profiles, and find that the outflow speed and the temperature gradients depend strongly on the assumed heating efficiencies.  Our models predict an upper limit of 8000K for the mean (pressure averaged) temperature below 3Rp, with a typical value of 7000K based on the average solar XUV flux at 0.047AU.  We use these temperature limits and the observations to evaluate the role of stellar energy in heating the upper atmosphere.\n",

      "Summary for The formation of sulfate, nitrate and perchlorate salts in the martian atmosphere: We used a 1-dimensional photochemical model to calculate the atmospheric production and deposition rate of sulfate, nitrate and perchlorate salts in the Amazonian martian atmosphere.  First we added bromine chemistry (see Appendix A) to the model of Catling et al. (2010) for the terrestrial atmosphere.  The model has recently been modified to study chlorine, sulfur, and nitrogen chemistry in the modern terrestrial atmosphere (Catling et al., 2010) and hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen chemistry in the modern martian atmosphere (Zahnle et al., 2008).  First, the deposition velocities for O2, H2, and CO are set to zero (following Zahnle et al., 2008).  As part of model development, we matched the calculated mixing ratios of H2O, CO, H2O2, and O2 to those in the modern martian atmosphere (following Zahnle et al., 2008) and then added chlorine and sulfur chemistry from Catling et al. (2010), as discussed in Section 3.1.  The sulfate deposition flux produced in the nominal model is compatible with estimates of the amount of sulfates on Mars.  On Earth, one source of sulfate, nitrate, and perchlorate salts is atmospheric deposition.  Implications of enhanced deposition of HNO4 on Mars, compared with Earth, will be discussed in a separate paper about N deposition on Mars (Catling et al., in preparation).  Before we added bromine chemistry to the nominal Mars model, we added the chemistry to the terrestrial model of Catling et al. (2010).  Increasing the surface pressure from 6.3mb to 35mb decreases the deposition rate of atmospheric perchlorate from 4.6×10-3 to 7×10-5moleculescm-2s-1.  Following the model of Zahnle et al. (2008), atmospheric transport, temperature, and relative humidity are initialized as follows.  Using purely gas-phase pathways, Catling et al. (2010) reproduced measured profiles of chlorine species in the terrestrial atmosphere and estimated deposition rates of both perchlorate and nitrate that were consistent with Atacama soil measurements.  The deposition velocity used in the nominal model is not a measured value.  We next calculated the perchlorate, sulfate, and nitrate deposition fluxes on Mars as a function of volcanic input.  In the absence of rain, perchloric acid accumulates on the surface through dry deposition, where it reacts with minerals to form perchlorate salts (Catling et al., 2010).\n",
      "We model a modified martian atmosphere to calculate deposition fluxes of salts.  Estimated sulfate soil concentrations are consistent with observed sulfate on Mars.  Pernitric acid forms more rapidly in the martian atmosphere than nitric acid.  An atmospheric origin for perchlorate is precluded (or supplemented by other processes).  In extremely arid regions on Earth, such as the Atacama Desert, nitrate, sulfate and perchlorate salts form in the atmosphere and accumulate on the surface from dry deposition according to diagnostic evidence in their oxygen isotopes.  Salts of similar oxyanions should have formed in the atmosphere of Mars because of comparable photochemical reactions.  We use a 1-D photochemical model to calculate the deposition rates of sulfate, nitrogen oxyanions, and perchlorate from Mars' atmosphere, given a plausible range of volcanic fluxes of sulfur- and chlorine-containing gases in the past.  To calculate integrated fluxes over time, we assume that throughout the last 3byr (the Amazonian eon), the typical background atmosphere would have been similar to today's cold and dry environment.  If the soil has been mixed by impact perturbations to a characteristic depth of ∼2m during this time, given a time-average volcanic flux 0.1% of the modern terrestrial volcanic flux, the model suggests that the soil would have accumulated 1.0-1.7wt.% SO42- and 0.2-0.4wt.% N in the form of pernitrate (peroxynitrate) or nitrate.  The calculated sulfate concentration is consistent with in situ observations of soils from rovers and landers and orbital gamma ray spectroscopy.  However, nitrates or pernitrates are yet to be detected.  The modeled formation of perchlorate via purely gas-phase oxidation of volcanically-derived chlorine is insufficient by orders of magnitude to explain 0.4-0.6wt.% ClO4- measured by NASA's Phoenix Lander.  The far smaller amount of ozone in the martian atmosphere compared to the terrestrial atmosphere and the colder, drier conditions are the cause of lower rates of gas phase oxidation of chlorine volatiles to perchloric acid.  Our calculations imply that non-gas-phase processes not included in the photochemical model, such as heterogeneous reactions, are likely important for the formation of perchlorate and are yet to be identified.\n",

      "Summary for Sets of lengths in maximal orders in central simple algebras: The next proposition shows that for divisorial fractional left or right H-ideals with H maximal, already both, Ol(I) and Or(I), are maximal.  If H is a maximal order, then the notions of a left H-ideal and that of an integral fractional left H-ideal coincide (this will follow from Lemma 5.6.1 and Lemma 5.6.2).  If H is an order in Q and I is a fractional left H-ideal, then Ol(I) and Or(I) are orders.  For all H′∈α and all g∈CM there exists a maximal divisorial left H′-ideal with [η(I)]=g.

      "Summary for In situ investigations of Fe3+ induced complexation of adsorbed Mefp-1 protein film on iron substrate: Fig. 8 shows the in situ ATR-FTIR spectra of the oxidized iron surface with pre-adsorbed Mefp-1 film obtained after exposure to the 10μM FeCl3 solution for different times.  Interestingly, if the oxidized iron surface is kept immersed in the Mefp-1 solution, the Raman spectrum is gradually transformed into that obtained when the surface is exposed to the FeCl3 solution, and already after an hour's exposure, the two spectra are basically indistinguishable (Fig. 10c).  In the Mefp-1 solution, complexes are mostly formed near the substrate since the Fe3+ released from the surface is immediately trapped by the catechols in the adsorbed protein film.  The topograpical images of the Mefp-1 layer adsorbed on the iron surface in the buffer solution and in the FeCl3 solution are shown in Fig. 4b and c, respectively.  This confirms our hypothesis derived from the IR measurements that Fe3+ is slowly released from the oxidized iron surface in presence of a Mefp-1 solution, and this results in the formation of Fe(Cat)3-type complexes, similar to those observed when the pre-adsorbed Mefp-1 film is exposed to the diluted FeCl3 solution.  However, the bands are relatively broad, characteristic peaks of the Mefp-1 were not distinguishable, which is mainly due to the concentration of the protein solution being low (0.1mg/ml), so the amount of Mefp-1 adsorbed on the oxidized iron surface was not sufficient to be detected clearly by the CRM.  In conclusion, our analysis strongly indicates that Fe(Cat)3 complexes are formed in the adsorbed Mefp-1 film due to the release of Fe3+ from the oxidized iron surface.  In situ Peak Force tapping mode AFM measurements were performed on iron QCM crystals (coated with iron) with a pre-adsorbed Mefp-1 film, immersed in buffer solution and FeCl3 solution, respectively.  In situ CRM measurements were performed using an iron substrate in the Mefp-1 solution and also using such surfaces with a pre-adsorbed Mefp-1 film in the FeCl3 solution.  Through a pre-conditioning to produce a stable oxidized iron surface, we have studied the film formation of Mefp-1 on the iron substrate and Fe3+ enhanced complexation of the pre-adsorbed film, by using in situ techniques including QCM-D, Peak Force tapping AFM, ATR-FTIR, and CRM combined with DFT calculations.  The spectrum of Mefp-1 on the iron substrate displays a strong peak at 1485cm-1 (Fig. 6b) that is entirely absent for Mefp-1 on the ZnSe surface (Fig. 6c).  When the oxidized iron surface was exposed to the Mefp-1 solution, there is no visible Mefp-1 band on the CRM spectrum after 1min exposure (Fig. 10a).  The property images in Fig. 5 and mean values in Table 2 show that the Fe3+ enhanced complexation of the adsorbed Mefp-1 film results in less deformation, a slightly lower adhesion force between the tip and the adsorbed protein film, and a lower energy dissipation as the tip is tapping over the surface.  However, it should be noted that there are some clear differences between the spectrum of Mefp-1 adsorbed on oxidized iron surface (Fig. 6b) as compared to that obtained on the ZnSe crystal (Fig. 6c).\n",
      "Pure iron was used as substrate for study of mussel adhesive protein adsorption.  Multianalytical in situ studies of the protein film forming and complexation.  Spectroscopy analysis was assisted by ab initial computational modeling.  Details of the film formation, structure, property, and compaction mechanism.  Tri-catechol/Fe3+ complexation leads to compaction of the surface protein film.  A range of in situ analytical techniques and theoretical calculations were applied to gain insights into the formation and properties of the Mefp-1 film on iron substrate, as well as the protein complexation with Fe3+ ions.  Adsorption kinetics of Mefp-1 and the complexation were investigated using QCM-D.  The results suggest an initially fast adsorption, with the molecules oriented preferentially parallel to the surface, followed by a structural change within the film leading to molecules extending toward solution.  Exposure to a diluted FeCl3 solution results in enhanced complexation within the adsorbed protein film, leading to water removal and film compaction.  In situ Peak Force Tapping AFM was employed for determining morphology and nano-mechanical properties of the surface layer.  The results, in agreement with the QCM-D observations, demonstrate that addition of Fe3+ induces a transition from an extended and soft protein layer to a denser and stiffer one.  Further, in situ ATR-FTIR and Confocal Raman Micro-spectroscopy (CRM) techniques were utilized to monitor compositional/structural changes in the surface layer due to addition of Fe3+ ions.  The spectroscopic analyses assisted by DFT calculations provide evidence for formation of tri-Fe3+/catechol complexes in the surface film, which is enhanced by Fe3+ addition.\n",

      "Summary for Rigorously modeling self-stabilizing fault-tolerant circuits: An ultra-robust clocking scheme for systems-on-chip: Rather, we allow for some stabilization time during which the module can \"clean up\" its internal state.  For simplicity, we hence may say \"node i is in state s at time t\" instead of \"state machine l of node i is in state s at time t\" when referring to Sil(t)=s, etc.  Outside these time intervals, reset ports are in state 0.  Formally, let P be a predicate on the input ports of node i's state transition module.  Hence, at the time when a node switches to ready, the delayed state information on the channels will not show non-faulty nodes in state propose any more.  In our algorithms, memory flags will be used to memorize wether an input signal from a remote node was in state 1 at some time after the most recent reset upon a state transition of one of the node's state machines (in Fig. 1, e.g., a node resets its propose flags when switching from increase to ready).  It takes the maximal delay until the nodes in A realize that 4⩾f+1 nodes reached state propose and switch to this state.  Now assume that each node runs a copy of this state machine, and at least n-f non-faulty nodes enter state increase during some time window [t,t+2d).  Most obviously, it cannot \"restart\" the system if all nodes are in state recover.  We define P holds at time t by structural induction: If P is equal to p=s, where p is an input port of node i's state transition module and s is one of the states signal p can obtain, then P holds at time t iff p(t)=s.  Node i's state transition module has input ports Si,j for each node j∈[1..n] as well as one binary input port for each of the memory flags, (randomized) watchdog timers and threshold gates it uses.\n",
      "We present the first implementation of a distributed clock generation scheme for Systems-on-Chip that recovers from an unbounded number of arbitrary transient faults despite a large number of arbitrary permanent faults.  We devise self-stabilizing hardware building blocks and a hybrid synchronous/asynchronous state machine enabling metastability-free transitions of the algorithm's states.  We provide a comprehensive modeling approach that permits to prove, given correctness of the constructed low-level building blocks, the high-level properties of the synchronization algorithm (which have been established in a more abstract model).  We believe this approach to be of interest in its own right, since this is the first technique permitting to mathematically verify, at manageable complexity, high-level properties of a fault-prone system in terms of its very basic components.  We evaluate a prototype implementation, which has been designed in VHDL, using the Petrify tool in conjunction with some extensions, and synthesized for an Altera Cyclone FPGA.  We introduce a novel modeling framework for fault-tolerant VLSI circuits.  We cast a self-stabilizing clocking scheme from a companion article in this model.  We discuss the implications of theory and model for the resulting implementation.  We present the measures taken to avoid metastable upsets despite faults.  We provide experimental data from a prototype FPGA implementation of the algorithm.\n",

      "Summary for Integral-valued polynomials over sets of algebraic integers of bounded degree: As IntQ(An) is the integral closure of the ring Int(Mn(Z)), in the same way, for every number field K, IntQ(OK) (which by (1) is an overring of IntQ(An)) is equal to the integral closure of a certain overring of Int(Mn(Z)), namely, the ring of integer-valued polynomials over the set MnK(Z) of matrices with characteristic polynomial equal to a minimal polynomial of some algebraic integer of maximal degree of K.  We may now represent the rings of integer-valued polynomials over a set of matrices MnP(Z), P a subset of Pnirr, as an intersection of the pullback rings Rα, where α ranges through the set of roots of the polynomials in P. Indeed, for such a subset P, by Corollary 3.1 and (5) we have:Int(MnP(Z),Mn(Z))=⋂α∈A(P)Rα=RA(P) where A(P)⊆An is the set of roots of all the polynomials p(X) in P (notice that by assumption all these algebraic integers have degree equal to n).  We remark that, as already mentioned in [8], this representation of Int(Mn(Z)) as an intersection of the rings Rα for α∈An, shows that Int(Mn(Z)) is not Prüfer, since there are many overrings Rα which are not integrally closed: by Proposition 3.1 it is sufficient to consider an algebraic integer α of degree n such that Z[α]⊊OQ(α); then the corresponding Rα is such an overring.  For a given number field K, the ring Int(MnK(Z),Mn(Z)) is not integrally closed and its integral closure is IntQ(OK).  More precisely, given a polynomial f∈Q[X] which is integral-valued over the set of all the algebraic integers of degree n, it follows that f(X) is integral-valued over the ring of integers of every number field of degree n.\n",
      "Let K be a number field of degree n with ring of integers OK.

A similar property holds if we consider the set of all algebraic integers of degree n and a polynomial f∈Q[X]: if f(α) is integral over Z for every algebraic integer α of degree n, then f(β) is integral over Z for every algebraic integer β of degree smaller than n.  This second result is established by proving that the integral closure of the ring of polynomials in Q[X] which are integer-valued over the set of matrices Mn(Z) is equal to the ring of integral-valued polynomials over the set of algebraic integers of degree equal to n.\n",

      "Summary for The prevalence of tinnitus and the relationship with neuroticism in a middle-aged UK population: Analysing data from a large population of UK adults, we have shown that the prevalence of tinnitus increases with age, and that a high proportion of sufferers report tinnitus as being moderately or severely bothersome, although age was not related to the perceived severity of tinnitus.  The UK Biobank assessment protocol did not include any tinnitus scale, nor did it measure the loudness of the tinnitus, however the subjective questions included have been deemed reliable in similar studies [2].  After controlling for age, sex, hearing difficulty and deprivation, this study found that neuroticism was associated with tinnitus and bothersome tinnitus.  Further analyses were performed using binary logistic regression to examine whether neuroticism is associated with tinnitus and tinnitus severity, while controlling for demographic factors (age, sex, deprivation) and hearing difficulty.  Neuroticism (measured on a continuous scale from 0 to 1) was found to be associated with tinnitus and bothersome tinnitus.  This study confirms previous research suggesting that hearing loss is a strong predictor of tinnitus, but we have also shown that personality factors identified as neuroticism are associated with the experience of tinnitus, particularly in those reporting that their tinnitus is severe.  Although such data would be desirable for better characterisation of tinnitus, a full tinnitus questionnaire would not have been practical to administer within the crowded UK Biobank assessment protocol.  This study reports the prevalence of tinnitus in a large population sample, while further exploring the link between tinnitus severity and neuroticism (previously only examined in clinical studies).  Increasing age was associated with tinnitus, but not in terms of tinnitus being bothersome.  Initially a binary logistic multiple regression analysis was performed with current tinnitus as the dependent variable ('no tinnitus' as the reference category) with all participants being at risk.  First of all, prevalence rates of tinnitus and bothersome tinnitus were obtained for males and females separately.  Estimates of age-specific prevalence rates of current tinnitus and current bothersome tinnitus are given in Fig. 2.  The proportion of participants reporting current tinnitus who state that their tinnitus is bothersome remains fairly steady for males of all ages at 22%, whereas for women this proportion increases from 23% to 26% with increasing age.\n",
      "Previous research has suggested that a substantial proportion of the population are severely affected by tinnitus, however recent population data are lacking.  Furthermore, there is growing evidence that the perception of severity is closely related to personality factors such as neuroticism.  In a subset (N=172,621) of a large population sample of >500,000 adults aged 40 to 69years, (from the UK Biobank dataset) we calculated the prevalence of tinnitus and that which is perceived as bothersome, and examined the association between tinnitus and a putative predisposing personality factor, neuroticism.  Participants were recruited through National Health Service registers and aimed to be inclusive and as representative of the UK population as possible.  The assessment included subjective questions concerning hearing and tinnitus.  Neuroticism was self-rated on 13 questions from the Eysenck Personality Inventory.  Associations between neuroticism and tinnitus were tested with logistic regression analyses.  Prevalence of tinnitus was significantly higher for males, and increased with age, doubling between the youngest and oldest age groups (males 13% and 26%; females 9% and 19% respectively).  Of those with tinnitus, females were more likely to report bothersome tinnitus.  Neuroticism was associated with current tinnitus and bothersome tinnitus, with the items: 'loneliness', 'mood swings', 'worrier/anxious' and 'miserableness', as the strongest associations of bothersome tinnitus.  Neuroticism was identified as a novel association with tinnitus.  Individuals with tinnitus and higher levels of neuroticism are more likely to experience bothersome tinnitus, possibly as a reflection of greater sensitivity to intrusive experiences.\n",

      "Summary for Structural studies of magnesium nitride fluorides by powder neutron diffraction: Bond valence calculations performed using the structure refined from PND data and the same rij and b parameters used for Mg3NF3 above [28], gave sums of 1.90 for Mg, 2.85 for N and 0.92 for F.  In this work we report the solid state synthesis of the nitride fluoride Mg3NF3 and the low temperature polymorph of the dimagnesium nitride fluoride, L-Mg2NF and provide detailed models of their crystal structures from powder neutron diffraction experiments.  Following the discovery of the magnesium nitride fluorides, investigations by Ehrlich et al. produced further alkaline earth metal compounds, Ca2NF, Sr2NF and Ba2NF, which were all reported from powder diffraction evidence to be isostructural with the respective group 2 rocksalt-type oxides [11].  Data were analysed by Philips Automated Powder Diffraction software.  As for 1, initial Rietveld refinement of 2 was performed against PXD data.  The first examples of these were magnesium nitride fluorides prepared by Andersson [4,5] and three phases were reported which had structures related to the rocksalt structure of MgO.  Powder neutron diffraction studies have confirmed structures in which the fluoride and nitride anions are completely ordered in both cases.  The refinement progressed smoothly and gave a good fit to the data using the L-Mg2NF structure as a starting model.  Parameters from both the PXD and PND refinements of 2 can be found in Table 3.  The profile plot for the refinement against PND data for the backscattering bank (〈2θ〉=145°) is shown in Fig. 3.

      "Summary for Two cores of a nonnegative matrix: Temporal variations in magnetic susceptibility, mass accumulation rates, clay mineralogy, redness, illite crystallinity (FHWM) and hematite/goethite ratios are plotted against the Qunf Cave climate record of Fleitmann et al. (2003) (Fig. 13).  The variations in clay mineralogy at both core sites are consistent with previously published data for the Arabian Sea (Sirocko and Lange, 1991) and Indus Fan (Kolla et al., 1981) in that smectite and illite are the dominant mineral groups.  We further test the ability of clay minerals to act as weathering proxies by comparing them with K/Al, which is the weathering proxy that is least affected by grain size or carbonate content, at least on the Indus Shelf (Limmer et al., 2012) (Fig. 12).  We further compare the temporal evolution in neodymium isotope values with the variation in clay mineralogy in the two cores considered here, as well as from the river mouth (Alizai et al., 2012) (Fig. 11).  Kaolinite/illite has also been used as a proxy for humidity (Thamban et al., 2002).  A stronger monsoon might favour greater hydrolyzation and stronger weathering causing a reduction in illite crystallinity (Lamy et al., 1998; Alizai et al., 2012).  Prior to 1947 under more natural conditions the Indus River delivered between 250 and 675milliontonnes of sediment to the Indus Delta annually (Milliman et al., 1984; Giosan et al., 2006) while since that time discharge has fallen sharply because of damming (Inam et al., 2007).  εNd values indicate that some of the sediment deposited in the Early Holocene at Indus-10 was sourced from the Makran region, presumably through longshore drift, as well as from the Indus River mouth (Limmer et al., 2012).  In order to compare our clay mineral assemblages with those from the onshore (Alizai et al., 2012), a ternary plot of kaolinite, smectite and (chlorite+illite) was constructed (Fig. 9).\n",
      "We present a multi-proxy mineral record based on X-ray diffraction and diffuse reflectance spectrophotometry analysis for two cores from the western Indus Shelf in order to reconstruct changing weathering intensities, sediment transport, and provenance variations since 13ka.  Core Indus-10 is located northwest of the Indus Canyon and exhibits fluctuations in smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratios that correlate with monsoon intensity.  Higher smectite/(illite+chlorite) and lower illite crystallinity, normally associated with stronger weathering, peaked during the Early-Mid Holocene, the period of maximum summer monsoon.  Hematite/goethite and magnetic susceptibility do not show clear co-variation, although they both increase at Indus-10 after 10ka, as the monsoon weakened.  At Indus-23, located on a clinoform just west of the canyon, hematite/goethite increased during a period of monsoon strengthening from 10 to 8ka, consistent with increased seasonality and/or reworking of sediment deposited prior to or during the glacial maximum.  After 2ka terrigenous sediment accumulation rates in both cores increased together with redness and hematite/goethite, which we attribute to widespread cultivation of the floodplain triggering reworking, especially after 200years ago.  Over Holocene timescales sediment composition and mineralogy in two localities on the high-energy shelf were controlled by varying degrees of reworking, as well as climatically modulated chemical weathering.  ► We examine a high resolution multi-proxy physical properties from two marine cores.\n",

      "Summary for Chemical weathering and provenance evolution of Holocene-Recent sediments from the Western Indus Shelf, Northern Arabian Sea inferred from physical and mineralogical properties: Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on data using soil dilution (10-1 and 10-6), planting regime (defined as either bare soil, planted non-mycorrhizal or planted mycorrhizal) and harvest time (month) as factors.  The dilution effects on soil OM were absent from the planted soils in the current experiment, although the AMF treatments had significantly less soil OM than either of the other planting regimes (bare soil and NM planted), possibly because of reduced root mass and species richness in addition to C losses to the AM fungi.  The minimal difference observed in aggregate stability between the NM planted soil and the bare soil is interesting.  PCA analysis separated out the bacterial communities associated with the mycorrhizal plants and the bare soil amended with the 10-6 soil dilution (Fig. 3a).  Therefore mycorrhizal colonisation resulted in soil with reduced bacterial richness overall compared to equivalent NM soil.  Bacterial TRF richness and microbial biomass-C were both greater in the NM planted soils than in the mycorrhizal or bare soils, with bare soil having the lowest biomass-C (data pooled across months).  In contrast to the other planting regimes (NM and bare soil) bacterial TRF richness was negatively correlated with aggregate stability in the mycorrhizal soils.  Dilution treatment affected pore size in the bare soil and the AM planted soil but not statistically in the NM soil.  AM fungal colonisation resulted in increased aggregate stability relative to NM planted and bare soil treatments as would be expected and this was most noticeable in soils amended with the 10-1 dilution and also in months 3 and 5.  Furthermore across all months, bacterial TRF richness was positively correlated with aggregate stability in the bare soil and the NM planted treatments.  The distance between pore spaces was less in the planted (NM and AM) soil than in the bare soil within macrocosms amended with the 10-1 dilution.  Since microbial biomass-C was similar in those two treatments, it can be concluded that (fungal) species richness was the primary cause of the increased porosity and of reduced aggregate stability in the bare 10-1 soil, probably because of increased metabolic activity of the fungi and of the bacterial constituents.  Planting generally increased pore size in soil amended with the 10-6 dilution but not in soil amended with the 10-1 (dilution×planting regime interaction, F2,35=22.18, LSD=0.049, P<0.001, Fig. 8c).  The design of the experiment made it possible to determine the relative influences of these parameters on soil porosity and aggregate stability in addition to soil organic carbon.\n",
      "This investigation examines the effect of manipulating soil microbial community composition and species richness on the development of soil structure over a seven month period in planted (with or without mycorrhizal fungi) and in unplanted macrocosms.  The dilution method effectively resulted in soil communities with consistently contrasting levels of species (TRF) richness.  In particular, the 10-6 dilution of field soil resulted in less rich communities in bare unplanted soil than did the 10-1 soil dilution.  However, this was not the case in planted soils where root activity was a powerful influence on species richness.  After seven months, principal components analysis (PCA) separated bacterial community composition primarily on planting regime; planted mycorrhizal, planted non-mycorrhizal and bare soil treatments all contained different bacterial community compositions.  A consistent finding in planted and unplanted soils was that aggregate stability was positively correlated with small pore sizes.  Mycorrhizal colonisation decreased plant biomass and also resulted in reduced soil bacterial species richness, lower percentage organic matter and smaller pore sizes relative to planted but non-mycorrhizal soils.  However, soil aggregate stability and water repellency were increased in these (mycorrhizal) soils probably due to AMF hyphal activities including enmeshment and/or glomalin production.  In contrast, bacterial TRF richness was positively correlated with aggregate stability in the bare and non-mycorrhizal planted soils.  Soil organic carbon was an important factor in all treatments, but in the bare soil where there was no additional input of labile C from roots, the percentage C could be directly related to fungal TRF richness.  The less species rich bare soil contained more organic C than the more species rich bare soil.  This suggests a degree of redundancy with regard to mineralisation of organic matter when additional, more utilisable C sources are unavailable.  Understanding the effects of microbial diversity on functional parameters is important for advancing sustainable soil management techniques, but it is clear that soil is a dynamic ecosystem.\n",

      "Summary for Soil structural responses to alterations in soil microbiota induced by the dilution method and mycorrhizal fungal inoculation: In this section we examine the nature of perturbations of Saturn's magnetopause surface orientation, given by the difference between measured surface normals and predicted surface normals from a large-scale model of magnetopause morphology (Kanani et al., 2010).  Two initial studies of the orientation of the magnetopause surface, each based on data returned by the Cassini Saturn orbiter during magnetopause crossings that occurred in an interval of a few days, have revealed evidence for wave activity on both the dawn side and on the dusk side (Masters et al., 2009; Cutler et al., 2011).  In Section 4 we showed that the dominant direction of perturbations of the boundary normal, including those normals for crossings clearly associated with waves, is related to the direction of the local magnetospheric field vector, and we highlighted that this magnetic field influence is consistent with K-H instability theory (e.g. Southwood, 1968).  In this paper we test the hypothesized dawn-dusk asymmetry in the K-H instability of Saturn's magnetopause for the first time by assessing the extent of surface wave activity using data taken by the Cassini spacecraft during 520 magnetopause crossings.  Although waves may have been present on the surface for the duration of a set of crossings, other drivers of motion of the boundary (e.g. the magnetospheric period oscillation (Clarke et al., 2006, 2010)) can play a dominant role in determining when spacecraft crossings occurred, each of which provides a \"snapshot\" of the surface orientation.  However, since this study uses multiple sets of Cassini magnetopause crossings to carry out a global assessment of surface wave activity on Saturn's magnetopause we can use our larger total crossing set to infer the typical properties of the dominant surface waveform.  The crossings associated with waves provide information about the nature of wave activity on Saturn's magnetopause.  In this paper we have used data taken by the Cassini spacecraft during 520 crossings of Saturn's magnetopause to examine the nature of wave activity on the boundary.  These surface normals can be compared to the normal predicted by the most recent model of Saturn's large-scale magnetopause surface that was constructed by Kanani et al. (2010).  We note that the absence of a dawn-dusk asymmetry in wave activity reported here is consistent with studies based on Cassini data that identified initial evidence for waves on both the dawn and dusk side magnetopause (Masters et al., 2009; Cutler et al., 2011), and a study that has demonstrated that there is no clear local time asymmetry in the properties of Saturn's low-latitude boundary layer that could be attributed to a dawn-dusk asymmetry in the growth of the K-H instability at the magnetopause (Masters et al., 2011a).  Since we rely on the number of crossings in our data set to reveal the global picture of waves on Saturn's magnetopause surface, we do not omit any crossings on the basis of an inferred low level of confidence in the associated normal.  These results concerning the orientation of Saturn's magnetopause surface suggest that both the MVA and TDA methods generally capture the true surface normal to within an angular uncertainty of roughly 30°, but in some cases the validity of the normals is questionable due to a low magnetic shear and/or a low MVA eigenvalue ratio.  This led to the identification of all the crossings that were part of a pattern of oscillating normals that is strong evidence for surface wave activity, hereafter referred to as crossings associated with waves.  The basis of this study of surface waves is the calculation of the orientation of Saturn's magnetopause surface for each appropriate Cassini magnetopause crossing.  To examine the occurrence of surface waves on Saturn's magnetopause we analyzed data taken during 520 crossings of the boundary made by the Cassini spacecraft between 28 June 2004 and 23 July 2007.\n",
      "Waves on the surface of a planetary magnetopause promote energy transport into the magnetosphere, representing an important aspect of solar wind-magnetosphere coupling.  At Saturn's magnetopause it has been proposed that growth of the Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) instability produces greater wave activity on the dawn side of the surface than on the dusk side.  We test this hypothesis using data taken by the Cassini spacecraft during crossings of Saturn's magnetopause.  Surface orientation perturbations are primarily controlled by the local magnetospheric magnetic field orientation, and are generally greater at dusk than at dawn.  53% of all crossings were part of a sequence of regular oscillations arising in consecutive surface normals that is strong evidence for tailward propagating surface waves, with no detectable local time asymmetry in this phenomenon.  We estimate the dominant wave period to be ∼5h at dawn and ∼3h at dusk.  The role played by the magnetospheric magnetic field, tailward wave propagation, and the dawn-dusk difference in wave period suggests that K-H instability is a major wave driving mechanism.  Using linear K-H theory we estimate the dominant wavelength to be ∼10 Saturn radii (RS) and amplitude to be ∼1 RS at both dawn and dusk, giving propagation speeds of ∼30 and ∼50kms-1 at dawn and dusk, respectively.  The lack of the hypothesized dawn-dusk asymmetry in wave activity demonstrates that we need to revise our understanding of the growth of the K-H instability at Saturn's magnetopause, which will have implications for the study of other planetary magnetospheres.  ► Surface waves on a planetary magnetopause transport energy into the magnetosphere.  ► Differences in the level of wave activity across Saturn's magnetopause has been predicted.  ► Kelvin-Helmholtz waves often form on Saturn's magnetopause surface.  ► There is no evidence for the predicted difference across the surface.  ► We need to revise our understanding of surface waves on Saturn's magnetopause.\n",

      "Summary for Surface waves on Saturn's magnetopause: Observations of the flux of atomic oxygen ions across the terminator from the day to nightside showed that this ion flux was sufficient to explain the observed ion densities in the nightside ionosphere at solar maximum (Knudsen et al., 1980).  In summary the observations of ion energies indicated that a nightward ion flow across the terminator at solar minimum can occur.  This instrument observes the ion energy per charge, E/q, the mass per charge, m/q, and the arrival direction of each ion as well as the number of ions observed.  The spacecraft velocity at periapsis (∼200km) was ∼10kms-1, which was larger than the ion velocities of ∼3kms-1 observed by PVO at these altitudes (Knudsen and Miller, 1992).  The dawn-dusk ion asymmetry showed larger numbers of ions on the dusk side than on the dawn side consistent with the previously reported observations of antisunward transterminator flow at solar maximum from PVO.  This suggested that in a substantial number of cases the ion counts nightward of the terminator were comparable to the values in the dayside ionosphere, although in general the ion counts nightward of the terminator were lower than those observed on the dayside as expected in the absence of a plasma source.  In situ ion observations made by the ASPREA-4 experiment onboard the Venus Express spacecraft at solar minimum have shown dawn-dusk and noon-midnight asymmetries.  In this region the spacecraft was in the topside ionosphere, where the ion density decreases with increasing altitude.  Theoretical calculations by Brace et al. (1995) showed that the transterminator flow could transport more ions antisunward than were required to maintain the nightside ionosphere and it was suggested that some of these ions might be lost to the solar wind.  Taken collectively the observed ion energies therefore indicated an ion flow predominantly in the noon-to-midnight direction.  The largest summed ion counts were in the polar region close to periapsis where the spacecraft sampled the lowest altitudes.  The interpretation of the antisunward flow was reinforced by observed asymmetries in the ion number counts.\n",
      "The transterminator ion flow in the Venusian ionosphere is observed at solar minimum for the first time.  Such a flow, which transports ions from the day to the nightside, has been observed previously around solar maximum.  At solar minimum this transport process is severely inhibited by the lower altitude of the ionopause.  The observations presented were those made of the Venusian ionospheric plasma by the ASPERA-4 experiment onboard the Venus Express spacecraft, and which constitute the first extensive in-situ measurements of the plasma near solar minimum.  Observations near the terminator of the energies of ions of ionospheric origin showed asymmetry between the noon and midnight sectors, which indicated an antisunward ion flow with a velocity of (2.5±1.5)kms-1.  It is suggested that this ion flow contributes to maintaining the nightside ionosphere near the terminator region at solar minimum.  The interpretation of the result was reinforced by observed asymmetries in the ion number counts.  The observed dawn-dusk asymmetry was consistent with a nightward transport of ions while the noon-midnight observations indicated that the flow was highly variable but could contribute to the maintenance of the nightside ionosphere.  ► The transterminator ion flow in the Venusian ionosphere is observed at solar minimum.  ► This flow has a velocity of (2.5±1.5)kms-1.  ► The occurrence of this flow is highly variable, but can be a significant source of the nightside ionosphere.\n",

      "Summary for The transterminator ion flow at Venus at solar minimum: We present data from the ELS and IMA, the two plasma instruments on MEX ASPERA-3 (Barabash et al., 2004), to study the energy distributions of electrons and heavy-ions during signatures of electron precipitation at Mars.  We use the space plasma instrumentation of MEX ASPERA-3 to classify the different types of asymmetry found in the energy distributions of electrons and heavy-ions during signatures of electron precipitation at Mars.  The events of electron precipitation signatures were then categorised according to the combinations of asymmetry as defined by the net flux directions found in the energy distributions of the electrons and heavy-ions.  Given these results, the electron signature presented above is classified in an energy distribution category where electrons and heavy-ions both have a coincident distribution directed away from Mars.  The combination of electron and heavy-ion energy distributions that make up category-2, suggestive of a downward current and category-4 with both up-going electrons and heavy-ions, is only considered for those electron precipitation signatures that have electron energy distributions with a significant asymmetry.  Peaked electron, \"inverted-V\" electron and electron spike signatures are observed most with energy distributions that have a net upward flux of electrons.  Therefore, this could be the observation of electrons and heavy-ions moving away from Mars similar to energy distribution category-4 described in Section 3.4.  Using the ASPERA-3 ELS and IMA instruments we will compare the energy distributions in differential energy flux (DEF) of electrons and heavy-ions at the times of these signatures.  Although the upward net flux direction of electrons for the majority of electron precipitation signatures is questionable, due to the instrumental bias from ELS and the isotropic nature of the energy distributions, an upward net flux of electrons is more definite and believable for cases of energy distributions that are non-isotropic.  At the times of the electron precipitation signatures, heavy-ions are observed most with an asymmetrical energy distribution that has a net upward flux of heavy-ions.  In this study, we will look at the combination of energy distributions of electrons and heavy-ion during signatures of electron precipitation and will attempt to classify different types of particle distribution asymmetries.  Even after discounting upward net flux of electrons from those signatures with isotropic electron energy distribution, category-4 still make up the second largest group and when added together with category-2 occur on 10% of MEX orbits.  Fig. 5(b) shows that the peaked electron signature at the centre of the spectrogram in Fig. 5(a) has an energy distribution of electrons that is highly isotropic and illustrates results from previous studies (Brain et al., 2006; Dubinin et al., 2009).  Note that out of the 40 events classified into energy distribution category-3 and indicating an auroral flux tube, 34 events had energy distributions of electrons with net flux of electrons directed upwards.  The net flux of electrons and the heavy-ions in opposite hemispheres of the energy distribution is suggestive of an upward current, with electrons moving towards and the heavy-ions moving away from Mars.  Therefore, the combination of energy distributions as classified by category-6 is one of the least common for electron precipitation signatures at Mars.  Note, this result is in conflict with the appearance of the energy spectrum, which suggests the electron spike contains tail electrons precipitating along the crustal magnetic field, unless those electrons have already been reflected by converging magnetic fields.  Energy distribution of the electrons measured by ELS was created with respect to the Mars nadir and compared to the corresponding energy distributions of heavy-ions measured by IMA.  Fig. 6(b) shows that the energy distribution of the electrons has a clear structure directed away from Mars, whereas the second panel shows that the heavy-ions at ∼400eV are found in the opposite hemisphere of the energy distribution directed towards Mars.  Looking at Fig. 7(b) the energy distribution during the electron spike signature shows a strong downward direction towards Mars, with a net flux vector of 15° to the Mars nadir.\n",
      "The different types of asymmetry observed in the energy distributions of electrons and heavy-ions (M/Q=16-44) during signatures of electron precipitation in the Martian ionosphere have been classified.  This has been achieved using the space plasma instrumentation of MEX ASPERA-3 from peri-centre altitude to 2200km.  ASPERA-3 ELS observes signatures of electron precipitation on 43.0% of MEX orbits.  Unaccelerated electrons in the form of sudden electron flux enhancements are the most common type of electron precipitation signature at Mars and account for ∼70% of the events observed in this study.  Electrons that form unaccelerated electron precipitation signatures are either local ionospheric electrons with enhanced density, or electrons transported from another region of ionosphere, solar wind or tail, or a combination of local and transported electrons.  The heating of electrons has a strong influence on the shape of most electron energy spectra from accelerated precipitation signatures.  On most occasions the general flow of heavy-ions away from Mars is unchanged during the precipitation of electrons, which is thought to be the result of the finite gyroradius effect of the heavy-ions on crustal magnetic field lines.  Only ∼17% of events show some form of heavy-ion acceleration that is either concurrent or at the periphery of an electron precipitation signature.  The most common combination of electron and heavy-ion energy distributions for signatures of electron precipitation involves electrons that visually have very little asymmetry or are isotropic and heavy-ions that have a upward net flux, and suggest the upward current associated with aurora.  Due to a lack of reliable measurements of electrons travelling towards Mars, it is likely we miss further evidence of upward currents.  The second most common combination of electron and heavy-ion energy distributions for signatures of electron precipitation, are those distributions of electrons that are asymmetric and have an net upward flux, with distributions of heavy-ions that also have a net upward flux.  Energy distributions of heavy-ions with a net flux towards Mars occur half as often as heavy-ions with an upward net flux.  There is also evidence to suggest we observe downward currents during electron precipitation signatures when we find energy distributions of electrons that are asymmetric and have an upward net flux, combined with energy distributions of heavy-ions that have a downward net flux.  Wave particle interactions and downward parallel electric fields may be responsible for electrons that display a large amount of asymmetry in the upward direction of the energy distribution and have a upward net flux.  ► We use ASPERA-3 to classify particle asymmetries during electron precipitation at Mars.  ► Most common type of energy distribution is of isotropic electrons and upward heavy-ions.  ► Distributions suggesting upward currents observed four times more than downward currents.  ► Heavy-ion flow at Mars mostly unaffected by electron precipitation due to finite gyro-radius.  ► Acceleration of heavy-ions is rarely observed during electron precipitation.\n",

      "Summary for Energy distribution asymmetry of electron precipitation signatures at Mars: For case CH, Fig. 5(h), we see the effects of plasma super-corotation in region III, where magnetospheric power reverses (now negative) and energy is now transferred from magnetosphere to thermosphere.  As discussed in Yates et al. (2012), most of the energy in region III is expended in accelerating magnetospheric plasma; in region II we have a situation where magnetospheric power and atmospheric power (the sum of Joule heating and ion drag energy) are equal, due to ΩM=0.5ΩJ.  For expansions, Cowley et al. (2007) found that the power dissipated in the thermosphere (and used to accelerate magnetospheric plasma) increased by a factor of ~2.5 resulting from a large increase in azimuthal flow shear between the expanded magnetosphere and the thermosphere.  Looking now at case EH, and comparing FAC densities with the corresponding result from Cowley et al. (2007) (expansion from 45-85RJ), we notice a few differences: (i) the magnitude of peak upward FAC in case EH is ~25% larger than that in Cowley et al. (2007) and (ii) case EF has no upward FAC at the region II/I boundary, contrary to results in Cowley et al. (2007).  Fig. 8(g) shows the energy balance in the thermosphere for case ES.  As in Yates et al. (2012), we divided the magnetosphere into four regions: region I, representing open field lines of the polar cap; region II containing the closed field lines of the outer magnetosphere; region III (shaded in figures) is the middle magnetosphere (magnetodisc) where we assume that the Hill-Pontius equation is valid for steady-state conditions.  This change in ΩM (see Fig. 2(b)) increases the flow shear between the magnetosphere and thermosphere and thus increases the FAC density in region III by ~15%.  Despite a resemblance in FAC profiles, upward FACs in the magnetodisc (region III) are ~2.5 times larger in case CH than the equivalent case (with a responsive thermosphere) in Cowley et al. (2007).  Comparing case EH with the equivalent expansion case in Cowley et al. (2007); case EH, in region III, has a maximum value of Ef (~12.6mWm-2) that is twice that in Cowley et al. (2007).  All the changes in flows discussed for case CH result from the super-corotation of the magnetosphere which causes a reversal in the coupling current, subsequently leading to a change in the sign of ion drag momentum terms in region III (see Fig. 9 and corresponding discussion).  Cowley et al. (2007) discussed 'transient' heating and dynamics in terms of power dissipated in the thermosphere via Joule heating and ion drag energy, as well as power used to accelerate magnetospheric plasma.  Powers decrease in region II due to the decrease in azimuthal flow shear between the magnetosphere and thermosphere (see Fig. 2(a)).  This energy transfer from the magnetosphere would act to, essentially 'spin up' the planet (Cowley et al., 2007) and increase the thermospheric temperature.  Comparing the energy flux profile of case CH with the equivalent case in Cowley et al. (2007), we see that in the closed field regions (III and II), peak energy fluxes are two orders of magnitude larger in case CH.  The outer magnetosphere (region II) and open field line region (region I) in this study is modelled using plasma angular velocities from Cowley et al. (2005).  The large increase in electron energy flux is caused by a substantial increase in flow shear between the thermosphere and magnetosphere, resulting from the super-corotation of the magnetodisc plasma (see Fig. 2).  Fig. 8(b) shows a large (≥4×) increase in ion drag energy and Joule heating rates which accounts for the temperature increase across regions III and II.\n",
      "The importance of the Jovian thermosphere with regard to magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling is often neglected in magnetospheric physics.  We present the first study to investigate the response of the Jovian thermosphere to transient variations in solar wind dynamic pressure, using an azimuthally symmetric global circulation model coupled to a simple magnetosphere and fixed auroral conductivity model.  In our simulations, the Jovian magnetosphere encounters a solar wind shock or rarefaction region and is subsequently compressed or expanded.  We present the ensuing response of the coupling currents, thermospheric flows, heating and cooling terms, and the aurora to these transient events.  Transient compressions cause the reversal, with respect to steady state, of magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling currents and momentum transfer between the thermosphere and magnetosphere.  They also cause at least a factor of two increase in the Joule heating rate.  Ion drag significantly changes the kinetic energy of the thermospheric neutrals depending on whether the magnetosphere is compressed or expanded.  Local temperature variations appear between ~-45and175K for the compression scenario and ~-20and50K for the expansion case.  Extended regions of equatorward flow develop in the wake of compression events - we discuss the implications of this behaviour for global energy transport.  Both compressions and expansions lead to a ~2000TW increase in the total power dissipated or deposited in the thermosphere.  In terms of auroral processes, transient compressions increase main oval UV emission by a factor of ~4.5 whilst transient expansions increase this main emission by a more modest 37%.  Both types of transient event cause shifts in the position of the main oval, of up to 1° latitude.  Theoretical study of how rapid solar wind variations affects Jupiter's magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system.  A solar wind shock causes the reversal of currents and angular momentum transfer from the thermosphere to magnetosphere.  Solar wind shocks lead to large regions of equatorward flow in the thermosphere due to the reversal in ion drag acceleration.  These rapid magnetospheric reconfigurations result in local thermospheric temperature increases >25K.\n",

      "Summary for Response of the Jovian thermosphere to a transient 'pulse' in solar wind pressure: At a test temperature of 20 °C, the fracture toughness, KIc, of the epoxy polymer increased with the addition of the S-CSR particles, from 0.70 MPam1/2 for the unmodified epoxy polymer to 1.46 MPam1/2 for the polymer containing 20 wt% of the S-CSR particles.  Further, the S-CSR particles significantly toughened the epoxy polymer even at cryogenic temperatures.  Plastic void growth, following cavitation of the rubber particles, only contributed approximately 35% of the toughening effect at room temperature, and its contribution to the toughness decreased rapidly at low test temperatures, especially for the epoxy polymers containing relatively high concentrations of the S-CSR particles.  The toughening events of the S-CSR particle-modified epoxy polymers can be summarised as localised shear-banding of the epoxy polymer initiated by the particles and internal cavitation of the S-CSR particles (which relieves the triaxial stress-state in the vicinity of the crack tip) followed by void growth.  Further, as found previously [39,50], the model predicts that at the relatively low test temperatures the former micromechanism based upon plastic localised shear-band yielding in the epoxy polymer dominates, especially for the epoxy polymers containing relatively high concentrations of the S-CSR particles.  AFM of the S-CSR-modified polymers showed that the S-CSR particles were well-dispersed in the epoxy polymer, see Fig. 1(b-d).  For example, a GIc value of 481 J/m2 was measured for the epoxy containing 20 wt% S-CSR particles at -109 °C.  This would appear to be the shell of the S-CSR particles, and the phase image indicates that this is slightly harder than the epoxy polymer.  These results confirm that the S-CSR particles remain phase-separated and do not plasticise the epoxy polymer.  However, it is very noteworthy that the addition of the S-CSR particles can significantly toughen the epoxy polymer even at the lowest test temperatures.  Finally, a clear feature that emerges is that the addition to the epoxy polymer of the S-CSR particles with a mean diameter of 0.18 μm and a very low glass transition temperature, Tg, of about -100 °C may indeed lead to significant toughening of the epoxy, even at temperatures as low as about -100 °C.  Finally, a clear feature that emerges is that the addition to the epoxy polymer of the S-CSR particles with a mean diameter of 0.18 μm and a very low glass transition temperature, Tg, of about -100 °C may indeed lead to significant toughening of the epoxy, even at temperatures as low as about -100 °C.  The fracture energies of the S-CSR particle-modified epoxy polymers were measured at a range of temperatures from 20 °C to -109 °C.  The presence of the soft polysiloxane rubber particles decreases the stiffness of the modified epoxy polymers by an approximately constant amount over the whole temperature range below the Tg of the epoxy as shown in Fig. 2.  Plots of representative compressive true stress-strain curves of the unmodified epoxy polymer and the modified epoxy polymers with 6 wt% and 20 wt% S-CSR particles are shown in Fig. 5.  This is due to the difficulty of initiating cavitation in the particles and the increase of the yield stress of the epoxy polymer, which greatly reduces the plastic deformability of the epoxy polymer, at low temperatures.  This observation clearly reveals that plastic void growth of the epoxy polymer has followed cavitation of the S-CSR particles.  In contrast, secondly, at the relatively low test temperatures the S-CSR particles are now longer truly rubbery in nature and, therefore, cavitation of the particles, which then enables subsequent plastic void growth of the epoxy polymer, is significantly inhibited.  The value of ryu, the Irwin prediction of the plane-strain plastic zone radius for the unmodified epoxy polymer at fracture, was calculated [52] using(19)ryu=16π(Kcuσyt)2where KCU is the fracture toughness and σyt is the tensile true yield stress of the unmodified epoxy.  (The volume fraction of the S-CSR particles in the epoxy polymer was measured using image analysis from the atomic force micrographs).\n",
      "An epoxy resin, cured using an anhydride hardener, has been modified by the addition of pre-formed polysiloxane core-shell rubber (S-CSR) particles with a mean diameter of 0.18 μm.  The glass transition temperature, Tg, of the cured unmodified epoxy polymer was 148 °C, and this was unchanged after the addition of the S-CSR particles.  The polysiloxane rubber particles had a Tg of about -100 °C.  Atomic force microscopy showed that the S-CSR particles were well-dispersed in the epoxy polymer.  The addition of the S-CSR particles reduced the Young's modulus and tensile strength of the epoxy polymer, but at 20 °C the fracture energy, GIc, increased from 117 J/m2 for the unmodified epoxy to 947 J/m2 when 20 wt% of the S-CSR particles were incorporated.  Fracture tests were also performed at -55 °C, -80 °C, and -109 °C.  The results showed that the measured fracture energy of the S-CSR-modified epoxy polymers decreased significantly below room temperature.  For example, at -109 °C, a fracture energy of 481 J/m2 was measured using 20 wt% of S-CSR particles.  Nevertheless, this value of toughness still represented a major increase compared with the unmodified epoxy polymer, which possessed a value of GIc of 174 J/m2 at this very low test temperature.  Thus, a clear fact that emerged was that the addition to the epoxy polymer of the S-CSR particles may indeed lead to significant toughening of the epoxy, even at temperatures as low as about -100 °C.  The toughening mechanisms induced by the S-CSR particles were identified as (a) localised plastic shear-band yielding around the particles and (b) cavitation of the particles followed by plastic void growth of the epoxy polymer.  These mechanisms were modelled using the Hsieh et al. approach [33,49] and the values of GIc of the S-CSR-modified epoxy polymers at the different test temperatures were calculated.  Excellent agreement was found between the predictions and the experimentally measured fracture energies.  Further, the experimental and modelling results of the present study indicated that the extent of plastic void growth was suppressed at low temperatures for the S-CSR-modified epoxy polymers, but that the localised shear-band yielding mechanism was relatively insensitive to the test temperature.  An epoxy polymer has been modified with polysiloxane core-shell rubber particles.  The epoxy had Tg of about 148 °C and the particles had a Tg of about -100 °C.  AFM showed that the particles were well-dispersed in the epoxy polymer.  The addition of 20 wt% particles increased GIc from about 120 J/m2 to 950 J/m2.  The particles also significantly toughened the epoxy polymer even at about -100 °C.\n",

      "Summary for The mechanical properties and toughening mechanisms of an epoxy polymer modified with polysiloxane-based core-shell particles: Since there is no significant difference in the measured GC for any particle diameter for a given volume fraction of silica nanoparticles; and noting that the other two particle size particles experimentally, as well as theoretically, showed debonding and void growth.  Hence, from both of these observations, it would be expected that all three piperidine-cured epoxy polymers, containing particle sizes of 23, 74 or 170 nm, examined in the present study will exhibit particle debonding, followed by plastic void growth of the epoxy matrix polymer, prior to fracture.  The smallest particles employed, i.e. silica nanoparticles of 23 nm diameter, showed no evidence of debonding and subsequent void growth of the epoxy polymer.  Namely, as implied above, the debonding of the silica nanoparticles from the epoxy matrix polymer appears to take place during the elastic deformation region and, as shown in Table 1, the yield stress for all modified epoxy polymers is approximately equal, irrespective of particle size.  As discussed in detail previously [16], there is no significant effect of the particle size, within experimental error, on the measured values of the fracture energy with the addition of silica nanoparticles, within the range studied of 23-170 nm in particle diameter (see Fig. 1).  This predicted value of 14.3% of the particles present that will actually debond, and hence lead to subsequent plastic void growth in the epoxy matrix polymer, was in excellent agreement with the observation from the fracture surfaces that about 10-15% of the nanoparticles present debonded.  The effect of the presence of the silica nanoparticles is clearly major, with the epoxy polymers containing 30 vol% of such particles having values of GC of about 1000 J/m2.  It should be noted that the contribution to the increase in toughness due to particle debonding is widely considered to be negligible and thus the value of interfacial free energy between the silica nanoparticles and epoxy polymer matrix does not enter into the formulation of the model [21-23].  The toughening mechanism due to the formation of extensive localised shear-band yielding has been previously established for epoxy polymers containing silica particles, when using both nanoparticles and micrometre-sized particles [13].  Thus, also observing that the contribution of the plastic void growth mechanism to the fracture energy, ΔGv, is predicted to be independent of particle size, it is suggested that particle debonding and subsequent plastic void growth in the epoxy polymer does indeed occur for the 23 nm diameter particles but that it is obscured by the coating process when the FEG-SEM observations are made.  The toughening mechanisms were identified as (i) the formation of localised shear-band yielding in the epoxy matrix polymer which is initiated by the silica nanoparticles, and (ii) debonding of the silica nanoparticles followed by plastic void growth of the epoxy matrix polymer.  However, there was no evidence of particle debonding and subsequent plastic void growth in the epoxy polymer, and this of course explains why the particles are more difficult to identify.\n",
      "Silica nanoparticles possessing three different diameters (23, 74 and 170 nm) were used to modify a piperidine-cured epoxy polymer.  Fracture tests were performed and values of the toughness increased steadily as the concentration of silica nanoparticles was increased.  However, no significant effects of particle size were found on the measured value of toughness.  The toughening mechanisms were identified as (i) the formation of localised shear-band yielding in the epoxy matrix polymer which is initiated by the silica nanoparticles, and (ii) debonding of the silica nanoparticles followed by plastic void growth of the epoxy matrix polymer.  These mechanisms, and hence the toughness of the epoxy polymers containing the silica nanoparticles, were modelled using the Hsieh et al. approach (Polymer 51, 2010, 6284-6294).  However, it is noteworthy that previous modelling work has required the volume fraction of debonded silica particles to be measured from the fracture surfaces but in the present paper a new and more fundamental approach has been proposed.  Here finite-element modelling has demonstrated that once one silica nanoparticle debonds then its nearest neighbours are shielded from the applied stress field, and hence may not debond.  Statistical analysis showed that, for a good, i.e. random, dispersion of nanoparticles, each nanoparticle has six nearest neighbours, so only one in seven particles would be predicted to debond.  This approach therefore predicts that only 14.3% of the nanoparticles present will debond, and this value is in excellent agreement with the value of 10-15% of those nanoparticles present debonding which was recorded via direct observations of the fracture surfaces.  Further, this value of about 15% of silica nanoparticles particles present debonding has also been noted in other published studies, but has never been previously explained.  The predictions from the modelling studies of the toughness of the various epoxy polymers containing the silica nanoparticles were compared with the measured fracture energies and the agreement was found to be good.\n",

      "Summary for The modelling of the toughening of epoxy polymers via silica nanoparticles: The effects of volume fraction and particle size: In addition, the installation of soil collars several centimetres into the soil, to minimize CO2 leakage in and out of the chamber (Hutchinson and Livingston, 2001), has raised concerns regarding the possibility of measuring δ13CRs beyond the collar insertion depth (Kayler et al., 2008), and their utility in soil respiration partitioning studies (Heinemeyer et al., 2011).  Assuming that roots, litter/humus, and SOM are the only significant contributors to the total soil surface flux of CO2, RS was partitioned among these three components using the δ13C values of RS (obtained with the dual-chamber), and the δ13C values of the CO2 produced from the three sources, as well as the mass-specific rate of CO2 production by each source (obtained from the incubations).  Generally, the slower molecular diffusivity of 13CO2 can induce CO2 in bulk soil to be up to 4.4‰ more enriched in 13C than that released at the soil surface δ13CRs (Amundson et al., 1998; Cerling et al., 1991).  However, the magnitude of the disturbance created by chambers depends on the soil CO2 production rate, and can vary with soil moisture conditions (Phillips et al., 2010).  The use of δ13C for partitioning the contribution of different sources of RS has the advantage of permitting in situ measurements with minimal disturbance to soil and roots (Hanson et al., 2000; Paterson et al., 2009).  Although transient changes in soil diffusivity and CO2 concentration gradient might constantly alter the relative diffusion rates of 12CO2 and 13CO2 isotopologues, Cerling et al. (1991) demonstrated that if soil respiration is at a diffusive steady-state, the δ13C of soil surface flux should theoretically match the δ13C produced within the soil.  Since Cerling et al. (1991) demonstrated that if soil respiration is at a diffusive steady-state, the δ13C of the soil surface flux should theoretically match the δ13C produced within the soil, much effort has been put into measuring the δ13C of soil surface CO2.  Thus the measurements made at the soil surface do not need to be corrected for fractionation due to diffusion.  This system also eliminates the use of soil collars, permitting quicker equilibration of CO2 concentration for the δ13CRs measurements, and minimal severing of soil surface roots and hyphae.  Following the method described by Albanito et al. (2009), in this study we used a soil surface diffusion chamber (here for simplicity named as reference chamber (Cr)), which permitted the estimation of surface CO2 concentrations at the locations where the chambers would successively be deployed.  For this reason, when a background ambient concentration is used in both steady-state and non-steady-state chambers, the vertical gradient of CO2 concentration at soil surface must be carefully considered in order to avoid the alteration of the soil profile CO2 diffusion gradient (Davidson et al., 2002).  In addition, we aimed to partition the soil surface CO2 flux into its components derived from root, litter/humus, and SOM sources and, alternatively, into autotrophic and heterotrophic components.  Researchers must always consider the uncertainty inherent in isotope measurements due to artefacts, spatial heterogeneity in the soil diffusive environment, possible advective processes which can cause transient changes in relative soil diffusion rates of 12CO2 and 13CO2 isotopologues, and time-varying 13C signals of different soil carbon pool.  The bottom section of the dual-chamber was in constant contact with the soil surface.  Third, using the measured soil surface CO2 concentrations as the baseline level for the dual-chamber operation, it was possible to achieve the necessary CO2 efflux steady-state conditions without using permanent collars inserted in the soil.\n",
      "The contribution of old soil C (SOM) to total soil respiration (RS) in forest has been a crucial topic in global change research, but remains uncertain.  Isotopic methods, such as natural variations in carbon isotope composition (δ13C) of soil respiration, are more frequently being applied, and show promise in separating heterotrophic and autotrophic contributions to RS.  However, natural and artificial modification of δ13CRs can cause isotopic disequilibria in the soil-atmosphere system generating a mismatch between what is usually measured and what process-based models will predict.  Here we report the partitioning of the soil surface CO2 flux in a warm Mediterranean forest into components derived from root, litter/humus, and SOM sources using a new, three end-member mixing model, and compare this with the conventional partitioning into autotrophic and heterotrophic components.  The three end-member mixing model takes into account both the discrimination during CO2 respiration/decomposition of the three components, as well as the fractions of their CO2 fluxes integrated over the total soil profile mass.  In addition, we used a novel dual-chamber technique to ensure that δ13CRs was subjected to minimal artefacts during measurement.  We observed that by using measured soil surface CO2 concentrations as a baseline level for the dual-chamber operation, it was possible to achieve and monitor the necessary conservation of the soil CO2 steady-state diffusion conditions during the measurements, without using permanent collars inserted deeply into the soil.  When RS (8.64 g CO2 m2 d-1) was partitioned into two components, the mean autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration was 56 and 44%, respectively.  When RS was partitioned using the three-way model, however, roots, litter/humus, and SOM contributed 30, 33, and 37% of the total flux.  Our results confirm that to improve the estimates of the partitioning method, it is important to distinguish the fractional contribution of the long-term SOM-derived flux from younger and more labile sources.  ► Natural variations in carbon isotope composition (δ13C) of soil respiration.  ► Dual-chamber technique to ensure that δ13CRs is subjected to minimal artefacts during measurement.  ► Three end-member mixing model for partitioning the soil surface CO2 flux.  ► Fractional contribution of the long-term SOM-derived flux from younger and more labile sources.\n",

      "Summary for Dual-chamber measurements of δ13C of soil-respired CO2 partitioned using a field-based three end-member model: Nevertheless, there is little information on the effects different species of AMF have on aggregate stability or on soil pore dynamics, or indeed whether different AMF species in disturbed conditions have complimentary functions in relation to soil structure.  Despite the lack of correlation between aggregate stability and AMF, rapid growth of G. mosseae hyphae suggested by Jansa et al. (2008) might be expected to result in alterations in soil structure relative to hyphae of other slower growing species.  Inoculum used in this investigation consisted of three different AMF species: G. geosporum, G. mosseae and G. intraradices, applied as a mixture of substrate containing mycorrhizal roots, spores and extraradical hyphae.  G. mosseae and G. intraradices have both been shown to grow at least 15 cm away from roots (Jansa et al., 2003, 2005) and the soil staining technique used in this investigation verified the presence of hyphae in all the AMF treatments, in both the rooted and unrooted zones of the macrocosms.  Soil porosity was affected by both AMF species mix (Fig. 3) and by roots (both as single factors, ANOVA, P = 0.015 and P = 0.003 respectively).  Roots stabilise soil aggregates through enmeshment and by the release of organic residues that bind soil particles and support many soil organisms, which in turn produce exudates and hyphae that assist in stabilisation (Morel et al., 1991; Jastrow et al., 1998; Hinsinger et al., 2009).  The data presented here demonstrate that different AMF species within the same genus may have contrasting effects on soil pore characteristics which could alter the micro-physical habitat for other soil organisms.  There has been much interest in the effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) on soil aggregate stabilisation and positive correlations between AMF hyphae and aggregate stability have been recorded, either from the direct effects of the hyphae (Degens et al., 1996; Jastrow et al., 1998) or from indirect effects resulting from glomalin production (Wright and Upadhyaya, 1998; Rillig et al., 2002; Rillig, 2004).  Smaller aggregates were not affected by AMF species.  AMF develop extraradical hyphae which radiate away from the mycorrhizal roots into the surrounding soil.  AMF species were inoculated individually and in every combination.  However in the current study, individual AMF species and combinations of co-occurring AMF species caused short-term effects on pore dynamics which may result in long-term impacts on porosity and aggregate stability.  A soil with a greater proportion of small pores (∼0.4 mm2) will retain water more effectively than a soil with larger pores; furthermore, small pores act as nutrient-rich habitats for soil microflora (Nunan et al., 2001).  The AMF species used in this investigation originated from the same site, although not from the field where experimental soil was collected.  In contrast to this, Bedini et al. (2009) demonstrated that MWD values of soil aggregates were correlated with total hyphal length (as well as density) of the AMF.  AMF in addition to roots and saprotrophic organisms also contribute to the formation of soil structure and stabilisation (Tisdall and Oades, 1982; Six et al., 2004; Rillig and Mummey, 2006).\n",
      "The spatial and temporal nature of the precise interactions between soil fungi and roots and their subsequent role in developing soil structure is still a subject where our understanding is limited.  This research examines the relationship between three species of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF) and soil structural characteristics.  Plantago lanceolata was inoculated with one of: Glomus geosporum, Glomus mosseae or Glomus intraradices, and every combination of the fungal species.  Infectivity was similar for each individual species, but G. mosseae and G. intraradices together resulted in the lowest per cent root length colonised.  Despite the lower percentage colonisation, this combination induced the greatest mycorrhizal growth response.  Aggregate stability and aggregate size distribution were unaffected by AMF but were increased by the presence of roots.  Microbial biomass-C was also enhanced by roots.  Pore size, pore size distribution and nearest neighbour distance were all reduced by G. mosseae and increased by G. intraradices.  All AMF inocula containing G. intraradices resulted in greater distances between pores within the experimental soils.  Porosity (%) was increased by G. mosseae suggesting that more, smaller pores with less distance between them enhanced overall porosity.  ► Soil aggregate stability was increased by plant roots.  ► Aggregate stability was unaffected by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.  ► Pore size was reduced by Glomus mosseae and increased by Glomus intraradices.  ► G. mosseae reduced distance between neighbouring soil pores.  ► G. intraradices increased distance between neighbouring soil pores.\n",

      "Summary for The effects of simultaneous root colonisation by three Glomus species on soil pore characteristics: As shown in Fig. 1, networks with 150 and 171 nodes were constructed from healthy and diseased soil samples respectively.  Soil OM was the key variable associated with the healthy community, as it stimulated members of H6 and H7 modules in healthy network but stimulated no module members in diseased network (Table 1).  OTUH4+H5 had 34 members in total (Fig. 4), 28 (82%) of which were also found in diseased network and were associated with the modules whose eigengenes were significantly correlated with one or more soil variables.  P47E2 as generalists resided in H2 and H5 modules both irresponsive to soil EC in healthy network (Fig. 2, Table 2), but became specialists residing in D4 module that was negatively correlated with EC only in diseased network (Table 2).  In present work, module eigengenes (the Ф values shown in Fig. 1) explained 38-63% of the variations of RA across different samples in healthy network and 37-63% of that in diseased network.  Thirdly, module members OTUH4 + H5 and OTUD2 + D6 were irresponsive to any measured soil variables in their respective networks but majority of which were found to be responsive in the counterpart network (Fig. 4).  Firstly, the generalist OTUs in healthy network were found to be specialist OTUs in diseased networks (Fig. 3), suggesting their role-shifts.  It is interesting to note that the nodes identified as generalists in healthy network were not absent in diseased network.  By using the network analysis tool, what a yield-invigorating (healthy) or -debilitating (diseased) soil fungal community was, what a healthy or a diseased soil was, how a healthy community became diseased, and what was the major cause(s) for the community shift were conceptualized.  These data suggested that the MMs belonging to Sordariales were enriched in healthy network and those belonging to Hypocreales were enriched in diseased network.  A conceptual picture on what was a healthy or a diseased soil could be perceived by looking at the responses of majority of fungal community members to soil variables.  Phylogenetically the proportions of MMs belonging to Hypocreales (21.5%) and Sordariales (20.3%) were similar in healthy network, but were substantially different in diseased network (36.6% and 11.3% respectively) (Fig. 2 B).  OTU910 belonging to Trichoderma stromaticum, for example, was one of D2 members, and was found in healthy network in module H7 whose eigengene was positively correlated with soil OM and NO3--N.  P47E2 (OTU424) from healthy network and one belonging to uncultured Cortinarius (OTU1058) from diseased network.  gM-156 and OTU464 belonging to Gibellulopsis nigrescens as generalists resided in the H6 and H5 modules both irresponsive to TN, NH4+-N and EC in healthy network, but became specialists residing in D3 module that was negatively correlated with TN and NH4+-N and positively correlated with EC in diseased network.  Secondly, majority of MMs (∼70%) were not shared between healthy and diseased networks (Fig. 2 B).\n",
      "Most previous studies on soil microbial communities have been focused on species abundance and diversity, but not the interactions among species.  In present study, the Molecular Ecological Network Analysis tool was used to study the interactions and network organizations of fungal communities in yield-invigorating (healthy) and -debilitating (diseased) soils induced by prolonged potato monoculture, based on the relative abundances of internal transcribed spacer sequences derived using pyrosequencing.  An emphasis was placed on the differences between the healthy and diseased networks.  The constructed healthy and diseased networks both showed scale-free, small world and modular properties.  The key topological properties and phylogenetic composition of the two networks were similar.  However, major differences included: a) the healthy network had more number of functionally interrelated operational taxonomic units (OTUs) than the diseased one; b) healthy network contained 6 (4%) generalist OTUs whereas the diseased contained only 1 (0.6%) marginal generalist OTU; and c) majority (55%) of OTUs in healthy soils were stimulated by a certain set of soil variables but the majorities (63%) in diseased soils were inhibited.  Based on these data, a conceptual picture was synthesized: a healthy community was a better organized or a better operated community than the diseased one; a healthy soil was a soil with variables that encouraged majority of fungi whereas a diseased soil discouraged.  By comparing the topological roles of different sets of shared OTUs between healthy and diseased networks, it was found that role-shifts prevailed among the network members such as generalists/specialists, significant module memberships and the OTU sets irresponsive to soil variables in one network but responsive in the counterpart network.  Soil organic matter was the key variable associated with healthy community, whereas ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) and Electrical conductivity (EC) were the key variables associated with diseased community.  Major affected phylogenetic groups were Sordariales and Hypocreales.  We constructed and compared two fungal networks from healthy and diseased soils.  We conceptually depictured what a healthy or a diseased community/soil was.  Nodes' role-shift prevailed when a healthy network changed to diseased one.  Soil organic matter, NH4+-N and EC were the key responsible variables.  Major affected phylogenetic groups were Sordariales and Hypocreales.\n",

      "Summary for Fungal networks in yield-invigorating and -debilitating soils induced by prolonged potato monoculture: The effects of the dopants were clear, with far higher charge carrier concentration, (N), than those found for undoped SnO2 thin films (1017-19cm-3 range) [1,2,5].  The results reinforce the position of fluorine as the best dopant and yield insight into the interaction between precursor components prior to thin film deposition; namely that of a halide exchange reaction.  Fig. 5 gives the optical characteristics of the doped-SnO2 films.  Films also show reasonably good charge carrier mobility, (μ), values, which may be constricted due to the high charge carrier concentration values obtained.  The images show the crystalline nature of the films as indicated by XRD.  The fluorine-doped SnO2 thin film demonstrates the highest energy plasmon absorption edge attributed to its superior charge carrier generation (see Table 1).  Hall Effect measurements identified all films as n-type semiconductors.  Values also indicate doping with fluorine results in smaller average crystallites as compared to the other halide dopants.  The nanocrystalline properties of the films are evidenced by both the broad SnO2 grain surface vibration band at ≈570cm-1 and the peak at ≈250cm-1, reinforcing calculated crystallite values [22,23].  The well-known facetted structure of doped tin oxide thin films is again observed and is indicative of a surface-nucleated thin film growth process [6,24,25].  We have also demonstrated that high-performing TCOs can be obtained from doping SnO2 with halide dopants using AACVD.\n",
      "We report on the effect of halide doping on the Aerosol-assisted Chemical Vapour Deposition of tin oxide.  Specifically, the importance of precursor interactions is highlighted.  A halide exchange reaction involving part substitution of the tin precursor is believed to occur in the solvent; the complex acting as a marker for improved films with improved transparent-conducting properties.  Precursor mixtures of butyltin trichloride and potassium halide (X=F, Cl, Br, I) in propan-2-ol were deposited at a substrate temperature of 450°C using air carrier gas.  Hall Effect results indicate that fluorine gave the best performing n-type transparent conducting thin films that exhibited high optical transparency (>80% at 550nm) and resistivity values of 4.9×10-4Ω.cm, with charge carrier density and carrier mobility values of 8.85×1020cm-3 and 15cm3/V.s respectively.  Such parameters yield high figures of merit.  ► Halide-doped tin oxide films were grown on glass using AACVD.  ► Fluorine is confirmed as the most effective dopant for TCO applications.  ► A halide exchange process resulting in a direct tin-dopant bond in the precursor.  ► This structure is thought a marker to higher-performing films.\n",

      "Summary for Halide doping effects on transparent conducting oxides formed by aerosol assisted chemical vapour deposition: As there are programs containing much larger coherent clusters, a program is placed in this group if it has a large cluster between the size 10% and 50%.  Coherent clusters are dependence clusters that include not only an internal dependence requirement (each statement of a cluster depends on all the other statements of the cluster) but also an external dependence requirement.  Comparing the definitions for slice-based clusters (Definition 2.2) and same-slice clusters (Definition 2.3), a slice-based cluster includes only the internal requirement that the vertices of a cluster depend upon one another.  This indicates that the same-backward-slice cluster splits into the two coherent clusters.  However, unlike a2ps the large coherent cluster does not break into smaller clusters but only drops in size.  We also found evidence of super-large clusters: 40% of the programs had a dependence cluster that consumed over half of the program.  It is interesting to note that although this grouping is based only on the largest cluster, many of the programs contain multiple large coherent clusters.  Other than the largest cluster which covers 48% of the program, the rest of the clusters are extremely small.  In all four landscapes there is a very large dominating cluster with other smaller clusters also being visible.  At the High setting this coherent cluster breaks up into multiple smaller clusters.  Splitting occurs when the vertices of a same-slice cluster become part of different coherent clusters.  Which structures within a program can coherent cluster analysis reveal?  The program at the bottom of this group (acct) has a coherent cluster of size 11% and the largest program in this group (copia) has a coherent cluster of size 48%.  The case studies form a major contribution of the paper and collectively address research question RQ4: Which structures within a program can coherent cluster analysis reveal? As coherent clusters consist of program vertices that are mutually inter-dependent and share extra-cluster properties we consider such vertices of the cluster to be tightly coupled.  The study exploits this unique property of coherent clusters to investigate whether or not a backward slice taken with respect to a vertex of a coherent cluster includes vertices of another cluster.  For our empirical study we use the size of individual clusters and the cluster profile to find mappings between the clusters and program components.\n",
      "Introduction of efficient clustering algorithm.  Empirical analysis to assess the frequency and size of coherent clusters.  A series of case studies showing how clusters identify logical program structures.  A study on the relationship between coherent clusters and program faults.  A study on the relationship between coherent clusters and system evolution.  This paper presents the results of a large scale empirical study of coherent dependence clusters.  All statements in a coherent dependence cluster depend upon the same set of statements and affect the same set of statements; a coherent cluster's statements have 'coherent' shared backward and forward dependence.  We introduce an approximation to efficiently locate coherent clusters and show that it has a minimum precision of 97.76%.  Our empirical study also finds that, despite their tight coherence constraints, coherent dependence clusters are in abundance: 23 of the 30 programs studied have coherent clusters that contain at least 10% of the whole program.  Studying patterns of clustering in these programs reveals that most programs contain multiple substantial coherent clusters.  A series of subsequent case studies uncover that all clusters of significant size map to a logical functionality and correspond to a program structure.  For example, we show that for the program acct, the top five coherent clusters all map to specific, yet otherwise non-obvious, functionality.  Cluster visualization also brings out subtle deficiencies in program structure and identifies potential refactoring candidates.  A study of inter-cluster dependence is used to highlight how coherent clusters are connected to each other, revealing higher-level structures, which can be used in reverse engineering.  Finally, studies are presented to illustrate how clusters are not correlated with program faults as they remain stable during most system evolution.\n",

      "Summary for Coherent clusters in source code: If an infinite cycle is located in the folded states, Spin will not be informed of any new Java state, and thus Spin will not be aware that the Java program is going to loop endlessly in those states.  This abstraction method, called state hashing, is suitable for checking cycles in Spin, and it can be used to detect cycles in the Java program and to check LTL liveness formulas in infinite executions of Java programs.  In our particular use of Spin, states are produced by the execution of Java programs.  As Spin implements the analysis of LTL formulas by translation to Büchi automata, thanks to our method to feed Java executions to Spin as input, we can check the formulas on Java programs with infinite cycles.  The first one consists of selecting the Java states to be sent to the model checking module: we only send those states produced after relevant events in the Java execution.  We take advantage of these C oriented features to communicate Spin with the JDI-based monitor, to represent the Java states in Spin, and to implement our abstraction methods for Java states, explained in Section 3.1.3.  Recall that counter and hash projections of Java traces t (ρVc(t) and ρVh(t)) discard all program variables except the ones in V, which are the only ones needed to check a temporal formula f, (V=var(f)), while the rest of the state is collapsed into a single variable.  After a specified number of folded Java states, we project the next Java state, even that state did not change any of the variables v∈V.  However, sometimes we do not intend for Spin to analyze complete Java traces.  The model checking module, implemented with Spin and a special Promela template, creates a series of Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) to execute the Java program with all the values considered for the configuration variables.  A Java trace t, as defined in Section 2.2, represents a possible Java execution of a given program.  A state of a Java program is a function σ:Var→A∪S that associates each variable with its value.  However, our use of Spin allows us to check infinite execution traces.  For each combination of input values, Spin launches a new execution and then enters a loop to collect the sequence of Java states for that execution, checking the LTL formula and reporting failed executions to the Eclipse plug-in.\n",
      "We use linear time temporal logic to represent both failures and desirable behaviors regarding a temporally ordered sequence of events and/or conditions to be checked along one execution.  We use model checking algorithms record the history of the failed execution, which we use to implement a controlled replay to locate the bugs.  We support the analysis of potentially infinite executions.  We use runtime techniques to start the debugging work directly on the programmer's code.  This paper presents an approach for the automated debugging of reactive and concurrent Java programs, combining model checking and runtime monitoring.  Runtime monitoring is used to transform the Java execution traces into the input for the model checker, the purpose of which is twofold.  First, it checks these execution traces against properties written in linear temporal logic (LTL), which represent desirable or undesirable behaviors.  Second, it produces several execution traces for a single Java program by generating test inputs and exploring different schedulings in multithreaded programs.  As state explosion is the main drawback to model checking, we propose two abstraction approaches to reduce the memory requirements when storing Java states.  We also present the formal framework to clarify which kinds of LTL safety and liveness formulas can be correctly analysed with each abstraction for both finite and infinite program executions.  A major advantage of our approach comes from the model checker, which stores the trace of each failed execution, allowing the programmer to replay these executions to locate the bugs.  Our current implementation, the tool TJT, uses Spin as the model checker and the Java Debug Interface (JDI) for runtime monitoring.  TJT is presented as an Eclipse plug-in and it has been successfully applied to debug complex public Java programs.\n",

The role of bacteria in OME has therefore been controversial.  This study clearly implicates bacteria in the aetiopathogenesis of OME.

Although bacterial DNA can be detected by polymerase chain reaction in 80% of patients, typically fewer than half of effusions are positive using standard culture techniques.  We adopted an alternative approach to demonstrating bacteria in OME, using a bacterial viability stain and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM): staining allows detection of live bacteria without requiring growth on culture, while CLSM allows demonstration of the three-dimensional structure typical of biofilms.\n",

      "Summary for Bacterial involvement in otitis media with effusion: For the ABC model, when Sv was small, the analysis indicated that both approximations adequately described both LCS positions and peak FTLE values regardless of Sw (Section 4.2).  The role of Sv and Sw in determining the accuracy of the two FTLE approximations given in Section 2 is first tested on the ABC flow.  When Sv is small, both FTLE approximations (FTLE3d2d and FTLE2d2d) adequately capture much of the larger-scale LCS structure (Fig. 3).  Plots of RMS FTLE differences (computed over the entire domain) as a function of Sv (Fig. 5(f)) confirm this steady degradation in both approximations over the range of Sv considered here.  Plots of RMS FTLE differences (computed over the entire domain) as a function of max(Sw) are shown in Fig. 9(f).  At all max(Sw) values considered, the RMS differences show that FTLE3d2d is a better approximation than FTLE2d2d.  Nonzero vertical (u,v) shear with zero vertical velocity (max(Sv)≠0,w=0,Sw=0).  Flows with Sv values exceeding this limit will likely be unstable.  Fig. 5(f) shows that FTLE3d2d is a better approximation than FTLE2d2d for all Sv values considered.  RMS FTLE differences (Fig. 5(f)) are convenient metrics for demonstrating the relationship between increasing Sv and decreasing accuracy in FTLE approximations.  Fig. 5 suggests that accuracy of the two FTLE approximations degrades steadily as Sv increases.  We study the impact of the vertical velocity and the vertical shear of the horizontal velocity components on the FTLE approximations in two analytic 3D flows.  For moderate to large Sv values, neither approximation adequately delineated the 2D LCS (Section 4.1).  To quantify the roles of Sv and Sw, the root-mean-square (RMS) differences between FTLE3d3d and each of the approximations are computed.  The LCS, on the other hand, pass through both maxima and minima in the Sv and Sw fields.  Analysis of the ABC flow (Section 4) identified the important role that vertical shear of the horizontal velocity plays in 3D LCS.  Like the ABC flow, it also allows Sv and Sw to be varied independently, so that the relative importance of vertical velocities and vertical (u,v) shear can be examined separately.  Next we explore how vertical (u,v) shear impacts the FTLE approximations when Sw=0.  In the analysis layer, max(Sw) values, range from 0.0864 to 0.8640days-1.\n",
      "Finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLE) are often used to identify Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS).  Most applications are confined to flows on two-dimensional (2D) surfaces where the LCS are characterized as curves.  The extension to three-dimensional (3D) flows, whose LCS are 2D structures embedded in a 3D volume, is theoretically straightforward.  However, in geophysical flows at regional scales, full prognostic computation of the evolving 3D velocity field is not computationally feasible.  The vertical or diabatic velocity, then, is either ignored or estimated as a diagnostic quantity with questionable accuracy.  Even in cases with reliable 3D velocities, it may prove advantageous to minimize the computational burden by calculating trajectories from velocities on carefully chosen surfaces only.  When reliable 3D velocity information is unavailable or one velocity component is explicitly ignored, a reduced FTLE form to approximate 2D LCS surfaces in a 3D volume is necessary.  The accuracy of two reduced FTLE formulations is assessed here using the ABC flow and a 3D quadrupole flow as test models.  One is the standard approach of knitting together FTLE patterns obtained on adjacent surfaces.  The other is a new approximation accounting for the dispersion due to vertical (u,v) shear.  The results are compared with those obtained from the full 3D velocity field.  We introduce two diagnostic quantities to identify situations when a fully 3D computation is required for an accurate determination of the 2D LCS.  For the ABC flow, we found the full 3D calculation to be necessary unless the vertical (u,v) shear is sufficiently small.  However, both methods compare favorably with the 3D calculation for the quadrupole model scaled to typical open ocean conditions.  Approximations of 2D Lagrangian coherent structures in 3D flows are studied.  Vertical shear is shown to be important in the three-dimensional flows.  A new approximate Cauchy-Green tensor without using vertical velocities is proposed.  Two velocity gradient diagnostics help to decide when the full 3D velocity is needed.\n",

      "Summary for Leaving flatland: Diagnostics for Lagrangian coherent structures in three-dimensional flows: XPS spectra obtained for (a) PLGA-HA fibres, (b) HA nanopowder, (c) CaP fibres.  As controls, HA nanopowder and PLGA-HA fibres were also analysed.  Moreover, consultation of the literature indicates that the spectra observed for CaP fibres is typical for a mixture of HA and β-tricalcium phosphate [22-24].  For comparison purposes, the X-ray diffraction of the HA nanopowder and of the PLGA-HA fibres were also recorded.  In PLGA-HA fibres, C 1s was found at 284.4eV, O 1s at 530.7eV, Ca 2p at 345.5eV, and P 2p at 130.2eV.  Pure PLGA fibres, PLGA-HA composite fibres and pure HA nanopowders were also analysed as controls.  It has been used to produce different types of ceramic fibres through the use of chemical precursors mixed to the polymer solution and by performing a thermal treatment on the resulting fibres [14,15].  FTIR analysis confirmed that the polymer was burnt out and evaporated during the thermal treatment since no characteristic of PLGA was observed in the spectrum of CaP fibres.  The spectra obtained from pure PLGA fibres and from HA nanopowder serve as controls.  However, the production of CaP fibres by electrospinning remains poorly investigated.  The slightly lower percentage of oxygen in CaP fibres, compared to the HA nanopowder, may result from the loss of OH groups (dehydroxylation) that occur at high temperature.  Wu et al. have created HA microfibres by electrospinning a polymer mixture containing Ca(NO3)2·4H2O, (C2H5O)3PO (precursors) and by performing a thermal treatment on the collected fibres at 600°C for 1h [13].\n",
      "Calcium phosphate (CaP) materials such as synthetic hydroxyapatite (HA, Ca10(PO4)6·(OH)2) and β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP, Ca3(PO4)2) are well-known for their potential in bone tissue engineering and drug delivery applications.  Processing such materials into submicrofibres might contribute to improve their biocompatibility.  This paper presents a new method for creating CaP submicrofibres through the electrospinning route.  A thermal treatment at sintering temperature (1100°C) was applied to electrospun polymer fibres filled with hydroxyapatite nanoparticles to cause aggregation of the nanoparticles and vaporise the polymer matrix.  The images taken by electron microscopy revealed that the treated samples maintained their submicrofibrous morphology.  Moreover, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis confirmed that the resulting fibres are made of hydroxypatite and tricalcium phosphates.  CaP submicrofibres can be produced by using a combination of electrospinning and sintering.  Electrospun fibres were produced from a PLGA solution highly concentrated with HA nanoparticles.  Heat treatments were applied to evaporate the polymer and induce sintering of the nanoparticles.  Hydroxypatite was identified to be the main material in the sintered scaffold.

      "Summary for Fabrication of calcium phosphate fibres through electrospinning and sintering of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles: Under irradiation, it is thought that the high mobility of undersized interstitial atoms, by a mixed dumb-bell mechanism in the matrix and pipe diffusion of Si in screw dislocation cores induced the formation of kinks in the screw dislocation, and the edge component caused significant Si and Ni segregation.  However, the mechanism for the screw dislocation acting as a sink for point defects can be found indirectly, e.g., it is known that the absorption of either interstitials or vacancies at a screw dislocation changes it to a helical dislocation having partial edge component [3,4].  In case of heavily irradiated matrix, many undersized atoms arrive at screw dislocation core, even in the absence of any driving force at the core, and eventually, get trapped at screw dislocation core.  In the Fe, Cr, Ni, and Si mapping, periodic fluctuations in solute concentration along the dislocation core were observed.  Therefore, the core of the screw dislocation is considered to form kinks or jogs with an edge component, which shows interstitial bias.  While the undersized atoms (smaller than Fe) such as Ni, Si, and P were found to concentrate near the dislocation core, the oversized atoms (larger than Fe) such as Cr, Mo, and Mn were observed to be depleted.  This phenomenon might have occurred as Si was absorbed at the screw dislocations.  The other solute atoms were enriched or depleted around the dislocation core and the kinks grew to jogs.  Fig. 3 shows the one-dimensional composition profiles of Fe, Ni, Cr, Si, Mn, Mo, Nb, P, Ti, and C around a screw dislocation core, obtained from the elemental analysis along the arrow shown in the box of 4nm×20nm in Fig. 3(c) and (f).  In this study, we apply the method to liner screw dislocations to discuss the solute-screw dislocation interaction under neutron irradiation.\n",
      "A three-dimensional atom probe (3DAP) technique was used to observe the three-dimensional solute distribution around screw dislocations in neutron-irradiated modified 316 austenitic stainless steel.  Si, Ni, and P were observed to get enriched around the cores of screw dislocations, while Fe, Cr, Mn, and Mo were depleted in the same areas.  Si was segregated to a narrow region in the core for which, it was concluded that Si was trapped in the initial stage of segregation.  Other enriched elements segregated to some edge features such as kinks and/or jogs formed as a result of Si trapping.  The results suggest that solute-dislocation interaction of screw dislocations was similar to radiation-induced segregation, which is affected by the volume size factor of solute atoms.  We observed screw dislocations in an irradiated 316 austenitic stainless steel by 3DAP.  Solute segregation around screw dislocation core was similar to radiation induced segregation.  Solute dislocation interaction on screw dislocations is affected by volume size factor.  Segregation behavior at screw dislocations suggests that a mixed dumb-bell mechanism occurred.\n",

      "Summary for Direct observation of solute-dislocation interaction on screw dislocation in a neutron irradiated modified 316 stainless steel: The results for these two cases are shown in Fig. 15(a) and (b) and reveal that the plate changes from a flutter mode of flight for F4, to an autorotational mode of flight for F1.  Model experiments and full-scale tests on plates were conducted and the plate's mode of motion was observed, together with measurements of plate trajectory, and velocities, all of which are affected by the wind field, model characteristics, and initial support configuration.  For the plate shown with counter-clockwise (positive) rotational speed, the horizontal and vertical forces acting on the plate over a rotational cycle are(2)FX=DH+LV,(3)FY=DV-LH-mg,where DH and LH are respectively the drag and lift forces acting on the plate due to the relative horizontal wind speed, Uw-up, and DV and LV are the drag and lift forces acting on the plate due to the relative vertical wind speed, -vp.  Fig. 13 shows instantaneous snapshots of a plate in each of the four flight modes.  Based on the results from fluttering and transitional plates, it might be postulated that provided the flight duration is long enough and the mass moment of inertia of the plate is sufficiently large to allow plate autorotation, a free-flying plate will enter into autorotation at a stable value of ω¯o, regardless of the initial orientation.  Fig. 18(a) and (b) shows instantaneous snapshots of the plate during flight for all three simulations.  In summary, the terminal vertical and horizontal speeds of the plate are therefore thought to be controlled by the autorotational drag and lift associated with the non-linear interaction between the plate and the flow.  This work has provided some insights into the influence of initial conditions (i.e. the fixing conditions and complex flow environment around the plate initially mounted on a roof) and flow turbulence to the mechanics of plate flight.  Here, both plates are seen to accelerate both in the along wind direction and the vertical.  Based on the results of CFD-RBD simulations, four primary flight modes have been confirmed, which depend on the initial orientation of the plate: autorotational, transitional, flutter and complex 3D spinning.  Chief among these was the ratio of aerodynamic force to gravitational force, K=ρUw2A2mg,where ρ is the density of air, Uw is the mean wind speed, A is the area of the plate, m is the mass of the plate and g is the acceleration due to gravity.  As described earlier, Tachikawa (1983) showed that debris trajectories are sensitive to the properties of the flow and the plate, not just its initial orientation.  In all three modes, the terminal vertical velocity of the plate is found to be relatively independent of initial orientation.  Similar findings have been reported from recent destructive wind tunnel studies of launch and flight of a plate from a low rise building roof by Kordi and Kopp (2011).  They observed that with oblique wind approach angles relative to the roof ridge, complex 3D spinning was the most dominant mode of flight and that the mode of flight was dependent on the approaching wind direction.  This continues to drive the horizontal velocity of the plate such that up>Uw (i.e. u¯>1.0).  We may decompose the flow field into a vertical wind component flow associated with the relative downward motion between the plate and the surrounding air, and a horizontal wind flow component due to the mean horizontal relative wind speed.  The horizontal velocity is however strongly influenced by the rotational direction of the plate.  The plate's rotational direction is strongly influenced by initial orientation, with plates having an initial orientation in the range -35°<αz<0° exhibiting ω¯z>0 while plates with initial orientation 0°<αz<45° have ω¯z<0, where the positive sense of rotation is shown in Fig. 3.\n",
      "A coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics-Rigid Body Dynamics (CFD-RBD) model is presented, which is capable of modelling the 3D flight of plate-type windborne debris.  The RBD model is based on rotational quaternions, which means that complex spinning modes of flight can be modelled accurately and robustly.  For debris that is free to fly in the absence of obstructions, it is shown that, depending on the initial plate orientation, a number of distinct flight modes are observed.  When the plate is aligned at right angles to the flow, the flight mode depends critically on the initial angle of attack.  The plate may wobble or flutter as it flies, never completing a full rotation, or it may enter an autorotational flight mode.  Depending on the direction of rotation, the plate is capable of flying faster than the wind.  It does this by converting some of its potential energy into rotational energy.  The rotation of the plate causes the forces acting on the plate to further accelerate or decelerate it, depending on the rotation direction.  When the plate is not aligned at right angles to the flow, the plate always enters a complex 3D spinning mode, with significant crosswind motion, which is absent when the plate is aligned at right angles to the flow.  This spinning mode is more typical of plates flying in real wind storms.  In addition, using a porous region to represent a simple double-eaved building, plates are launched from the roof and their trajectory is simulated.  The complex flow fields around the building result in more realistic plate trajectories.  For this particular scenario, large suctions on the windward slope of the roof produce large amounts of lift in the plates released from that position, causing them to fly well above the building, never entering the wake of the building.  ► We use CFD coupled to Rigid Body Dynamics to study the flight of windborne debris.  ► Different modes of flight are identifiable, dependent on the initial orientation.  ► Some debris flies faster than the wind as potential energy is converted to kinetic.  ► Plates are shown launched from the roof of a typical building.  ► The predicted flights compare well with limited experimental observations.\n",

      "Summary for An investigation of plate-type windborne debris flight using coupled CFD-RBD models.: Wind speed observations from the lidar using the DBS method were compared with data from a sonic anemometer located at 190m during the period 06/07/2010-11/01/2012.  This instrument will be used as a reference with which to compare wind data gathered by the lidar.  Fig. 7 shows the 60min averaged horizontal wind speeds obtained using the lidar DBS method and the sonic anemometer.  Data collected when the sonic anemometer records a wind direction between 315° and 45° are removed as wind speed data from the sonic anemometer in these conditions is considered to be unreliable.  A linear fit has been applied to the data using a weighted total least squares, with the weighting determined by the sampling error of each hourly mean wind speed from both the sonic anemometer and the lidar (Section 2.2.4).  Fig. 8 shows the mean difference between wind speeds measured by the lidar and sonic anemometer against anemometer wind speed.  These three scans can all be carried out using a single Doppler lidar, but two or more lidars may also be used to measure different components of the wind in a common volume (Collier et al., 2005), or to create a 'virtual tower' (Calhoun et al., 2006) using intersecting RHI scans for measuring wind profiles.  An estimate of the uncertainty of the lidar wind speeds was calculated and the suitability of the DBS method for urban wind profiling was assessed.  In order to evaluate the performance of the DBS scanning technique, data from the sonic anemometer at the BT Tower was compared with data from the lidar gate corresponding to the height of the BT Tower instruments.  Compared to other lidar wind profiling methods (e.g. VAD), which take many more samples, DBS is relatively fast.  Although the corrections applied by Barlow et al. (2011b) were small (≈2% of the mean wind speed), data from the sonic anemometer are examined here to determine whether flow distortion has a substantial effect on the instrument in this new position.  In order to compare data from an anemometer with the lidar, the height above ground of the anemometer must exceed the minimum range of the lidar.  After removing data from the sonic anemometer affected by flow distortion, and correcting for a ≈0.5° tilt of the lidar, the data from the two instruments were compared.  The mean difference between the two instruments remains fairly constant, with the lidar overestimating the wind speed by between 0 and 0.5ms-1.  At wind speeds greater than 20ms-1 the lidar appears to be overestimating the wind speed.  Another potential source of error in the lidar wind speed measurements is a tilting of the instrument so that the beam is slightly offset from its intended position.\n",
      "Currently there are few observations of the urban wind field at heights other than rooftop level.  Remote sensing instruments such as Doppler lidars provide wind speed data at many heights, which would be useful in determining wind loadings of tall buildings, and predicting local air quality.  Studies comparing remote sensing with traditional anemometers carried out in flat, homogeneous terrain often use scan patterns which take several minutes.  In an urban context the flow changes quickly in space and time, so faster scans are required to ensure little change in the flow over the scan period.  We compare 3993h of wind speed data collected using a three-beam Doppler lidar wind profiling method with data from a sonic anemometer (190m).  Both instruments are located in central London, UK; a highly built-up area.  Based on wind profile measurements every 2min, the uncertainty in the hourly mean wind speed due to the sampling frequency is 0.05-0.11ms-1.  The lidar tended to overestimate the wind speed by ≈0.5ms-1 for wind speeds below 20ms-1.  Accuracy may be improved by increasing the scanning frequency of the lidar.  This method is considered suitable for use in urban areas.  There is a need for more wind speed data collected above rooftop level in cities.  Remote sensing instruments can measure throughout the boundary layer.  Rapid evolution of the flow above cities means a short scan time is needed.  Data using a 3-beam Doppler lidar profiling method was compared with an anemometer.  The 3-beam method was found to be suitable for use in urban areas.\n",

      "Summary for An assessment of a three-beam Doppler lidar wind profiling method for use in urban areas: Fig. 10 shows contour plots of the mean concentration at two different heights z=0.23H and z=0.98H for 0° and 45° flow over the aligned array.  Fig. 16 shows corresponding plots for blocks immediately above the array for the 45° flow.  Fig. 4e and f shows the corresponding pattern of streamlines for flow at 45° over the staggered array.  This is consistent with the picture that material released at the initial source location moves horizontally into the wake region of adjacent buildings where it is then pushed up by the updraft flow visualised in Section 3.1.3 and then spread by the faster flow above the array.  As in the 0° flow, the fluctuation intensity I is larger than within the array; it generally decreases with distance from the source, except when the mean concentration C is very small.  Fig. 4c and d shows the flow structure for the flow at 45° over the aligned array.  Figs. 13-16 show concentration time series and computed statistics at different locations within and just above the aligned array for 0° and 45° flow.  Qualitatively similar flow features are observed for 45° flow in the staggered array (Fig. 7), except in the last two vertical planes at x=1.39H and x=1.64H, where the presence of a building at the end of the street at x=2H (see Fig. 5b) gives rise to a reverse flow region in the middle part of the plane shown.  Fig. 4a and b shows the streamlines for a 0° flow.  The whole plume is displaced downstream relative to that within the array due to the fast flow above.  Additionally, we present results for new simulations done for flow at an angle of 45° over a smaller staggered array of domain size 8H x 8H×8H x 8H×8H - see Fig. 1c.  Corresponding time series and concentration statistics are shown for the blocks just above the array in Fig. 14.  This is illustrated here for the 45° aligned array case by looking at lateral profiles of concentration just above the array (at z=1.02H) at different distances from the original source (Fig. 12).  In Fig. 10a and b (which show results for the 0° case) the flow is perpendicular to the faces of the cubes.\n",
      "Dispersion in the near-field region of localised releases in urban areas is difficult to predict because of the strong influence of individual buildings.  Effects include upstream dispersion, trapping of material into building wakes and enhanced concentration fluctuations.  As a result, concentration patterns are highly variable in time and mean profiles in the near field are strongly non-Gaussian.  These aspects of near-field dispersion are documented by analysing data from direct numerical simulations in arrays of building-like obstacles and are related to the underlying flow structure.  The mean flow structure around the buildings is found to exert a strong influence over the dispersion of material in the near field.  Diverging streamlines around buildings enhance lateral dispersion.  Entrainment of material into building wakes in the very near field gives rise to secondary sources, which then affect the subsequent dispersion pattern.  High levels of concentration fluctuations are also found in this very near field; the fluctuation intensity is of order 2 to 5.  We document key aspects of near-field dispersion in urban areas using DNS data.  We relate these dispersion features to the underlying flow structure.  The effects of wind direction, building layout and source location are examined.  Secondary sources in the near field have a strong effect on the plume spread.  Concentration means and fluctuations are mapped and their magnitudes quantified.\n",

      "Summary for Flow structure and near-field dispersion in arrays of building-like obstacles: It demonstrates which actions can be executed in what level to achieve SLA adherence and efficient resource allocation for Cloud infrastructures.  For the rule-based approach we first introduce several resource policy modes to reflect the overall utilization of the system in the VM configuration rules.  Design, Implementation and Evaluation of two KM techniques for one escalation level, i.e., VM resource configuration: CBR, and the rule-based approach.  However, fewer SLA violations result in lower resource utilization (cf.  Fig. 9(b) shows resource utilization.  Fig. 12(a)), all 2.* scenarios approach the result achieved by the best case scenario 3.  This is possible, because Scenario 2.6 achieves a very good utilization and SLA violation rate with a very low number of reallocation actions.  So violations and actions measure (as a percentage) the amount of occurring violations/actions in relation to all possible violations/actions, and utilization the average utilization over all iterations (and over all SLA parameters, if they are not shown explicitly).  To use the SLA parameters storage and incoming bandwidth for example, a typical use case looks like this: SLA id=1 with SLO1 (\"Storage\", ≥, 1000) and SLO1 (\"Bandwidth\", ≥, 50.0).  Nevertheless, when we relate SLA violations and resource utilization in terms of RAE, all CBR methods are generally better than the default method, especially for α∈{0.3,0.5} after five iterations.  As depicted in Fig. 11(a)-(c) one sees violations, utilization, as well as the number of reconfiguration actions, respectively, for every parameter (together with an average value) in the different scenarios.  We demonstrate by simulation that the rule-based approach can guarantee the resource requirements in terms of CPU, memory and storage for the execution of the workflow in a resource-efficient way.  The goal of the simulation engine is to evaluate the quality of a KM system with respect to the number of SLA violations, the utilization of the resources and the number of required reallocation actions.  As violations are very low in general, the resource allocation efficiency is very similar to the utilization.  A more general approach also taking into account the cost of actions represents the definition of a generic cost function that maps SLA violations, resource wastage and the costs of executed actions into a monetary unit, which we want to call Cloud EUR.\n",
      "To guarantee the vision of Cloud Computing QoS goals between the Cloud provider and the customer have to be dynamically met.  This so-called Service Level Agreement (SLA) enactment should involve little human-based interaction in order to guarantee the scalability and efficient resource utilization of the system.  To achieve this we start from Autonomic Computing, examine the autonomic control loop and adapt it to govern Cloud Computing infrastructures.  We first hierarchically structure all possible adaptation actions into so-called escalation levels.  We then focus on one of these levels by analyzing monitored data from virtual machines and making decisions on their resource configuration with the help of knowledge management (KM).  The monitored data stems both from synthetically generated workload categorized in different workload volatility classes and from a real-world scenario: scientific workflow applications in bioinformatics.  As KM techniques, we investigate two methods, Case-Based Reasoning and a rule-based approach.  We design and implement both of them and evaluate them with the help of a simulation engine.  Simulation reveals the feasibility of the CBR approach and major improvements by the rule-based approach considering SLA violations, resource utilization, the number of necessary reconfigurations and time performance for both, synthetically generated and real-world data.  ► We apply knowledge management to guarantee SLAs and low resource wastage in Clouds.  ► Escalation levels provide a hierarchical model to structure possible reconfiguration actions.  ► Case-Based Reasoning and rule-based approach prove feasibility as KM techniques.  ► In-depth evaluation of rule-based approach shows major improvements towards CBR.  ► KM is applied to real-world data gathered from scientific bioinformatic workflows.\n",

      "Summary for Adaptive resource configuration for Cloud infrastructure management: Effect of fast local memory size: in some algorithms, including the dynamic programming via matrix multiplication, the size of the fast memory affects the performance of the algorithm in the TMM model.  In this experiment we verify the effect of this fast memory size on algorithm performance.  Section 5 provides the lessons learned from this model; in particular, we see that algorithms that have the same PRAM performance have different performance in the TMM model since they are better at hiding memory latency with fewer threads.  Therefore, if there are enough threads, we should, in principle, be able to use PRAM algorithms on such machines, since we can ignore the effect of memory transfers which is exactly what PRAM model does.  Since no highly-threaded, many-core machine allows an infinite number of threads, it is important to understand both (1) how many threads does a particular algorithm need to achieve PRAM performance, and (2) how does an algorithm perform when it has fewer threads than required to get PRAM performance?  In addition, for certain problem sizes which fit in local memory, algorithms which are faster on PRAM may be slower under the TMM model.  In particular, we compare these algorithms and find specific relationships between hardware parameters (latency, fast memory size, limits on number of threads) under which some algorithms are better than others even if they have the same PRAM cost.  The TMM model is a high-level abstract model, meant to be applicable to many instantiations of hardware platforms that feature a large number of threads with fast context switching and a hierarchical memory subsystem of at least two levels with a large memory latency gap in between.  M represents the total number of global memory operations performed by the algorithm.  Among our shortest paths algorithms, only the dynamic programming algorithm makes use of the local memory and the running time depends on this fast memory size.  The PRAM model also ignores the vagaries of the memory hierarchy and assumes that each memory access by the algorithm takes unit time.  However, the TMM model predicts that performance can depend on the graph's density, when the number of threads is insufficient for the performance to be equivalent to the PRAM model.  Johnson's algorithm is not taking advantage of the fast local memory, and this factor influences the number of threads required to hide the latency to global memory.  If the latency of transfers from slow memory to fast memory is small, or if the number of threads per processor is infinite, then this model generally provides the same analysis results as the PRAM analysis.  The TMM model indicates that when the number of threads is small, the performance of algorithms depends on the number of threads.  In particular, it requires the work and depth (like PRAM algorithms), but also requires the analysis of the number of memory accesses.  In this paper, we present a memory access model, called the Threaded Many-core Memory (TMM) model, that is well suited for modern highly-threaded, many-core systems that employ many threads and fast context switching to hide memory latency.\n",
      "A number of highly-threaded, many-core architectures hide memory-access latency by low-overhead context switching among a large number of threads.  The speedup of a program on these machines depends on how well the latency is hidden.  If the number of threads were infinite, theoretically, these machines could provide the performance predicted by the PRAM analysis of these programs.  However, the number of threads per processor is not infinite, and is constrained by both hardware and algorithmic limits.  In this paper, we introduce the Threaded Many-core Memory (TMM) model which is meant to capture the important characteristics of these highly-threaded, many-core machines.  Since we model some important machine parameters of these machines, we expect analysis under this model to provide a more fine-grained and accurate performance prediction than the PRAM analysis.  We analyze 4 algorithms for the classic all pairs shortest paths problem under this model.  We find that even when two algorithms have the same PRAM performance, our model predicts different performance for some settings of machine parameters.  For example, for dense graphs, the dynamic programming algorithm and Johnson's algorithm have the same performance in the PRAM model.  However, our model predicts different performance for large enough memory-access latency and validates the intuition that the dynamic programming algorithm performs better on these machines.  We validate several predictions made by our model using empirical measurements on an instantiation of a highly-threaded, many-core machine, namely the NVIDIA GTX 480.  We design a memory model to analyze algorithms for highly-threaded many-core systems.  The model captures significant factors of performance: work, span, and memory accesses.  We show the model is better than PRAM by applying both to 4 shortest paths algorithms.  Empirical performance is effectively predicted by our model in many circumstances.  It is the first formalized asymptotic model helpful for algorithm design on many-cores.\n",

      "Summary for A memory access model for highly-threaded many-core architectures: A network node represents a complete SpiNNaker chip, with all its cores and its router.  The basic unit of the system is the SpiNNaker chip (Fig. 4), custom GALS SoC with a network router and 18 cores sharing some resources such as a SRAM, a boot ROM, a System Controller, an Ethernet interface and an 128Mbyte off-chip (but in-package, see Fig. 2) SDRAM.  The System Controller can disable or reconfigure chip components.  As far as we know, the node was built (under the codename T0), but the system never operated as a network.  All units within a SpiNNaker chip are provided with two levels of reset.  SpiNNaker is an application specific design intended to model large biological neural networks - the name \"SpiNNaker\" being derived from 'Spiking Neural Network architecture'.  The System Controller supports soft and hard resets of the different components within a chip and also communicates with the System Controller in neighbouring chips.  We can see that even with a single failure the system with emergency routing deactivated (approx.  Thus the FACETS system, and its associated HICANN devices, once again represent a very different system designed to solve a different problem: faster than real-time neural simulation, for which power consumption is not a factor and fault tolerance merely a side effect rather than a design feature.  Systems of this kind are fault tolerant in the sense of being reconfigurable in the event of a failed link; however they are not live-reroutable, thus the system provides no protection against transient faults nor does it permit packet recovery or retransmission while the system is active.\n",

SpiNNaker is a biologically-inspired massively-parallel computer designed to model up to a billion spiking neurons in real-time.  A full-fledged implementation of a SpiNNaker system will comprise more than 105 integrated circuits (half of which are SDRAMs and half multi-core systems-on-chip).  Given this scale, it is unavoidable that some components fail and, in consequence, fault-tolerance is a foundation of the system design.  Although the target application can tolerate a certain, low level of failures, important efforts have been devoted to incorporate different techniques for fault tolerance.

      "Summary for SpiNNaker: Fault tolerance in a power- and area- constrained large-scale neuromimetic architecture: In the Costa Rican experiment reduction in average SOC stocks in 10-40cm depth soil occurred in all shade and management treatments.  Over the whole 0-40cm soil depth there was a decrease in SOC stock during the experiment for three and an increase in two of the shade treatments.  Therefore, over the whole 0-40cm soil depth there was a similar mean decrease in SOC stock between the two pruned and two un-pruned shade types (9.9 and 9.7MgCha-1 respectively); thus the average SOC stock increased across all treatments by 8.5% in the top 10cm of soil and decreased by 21.8% in the 10-40cm depth.  In the Nicaraguan experiment the previous land use had been coffee with shade trees and no drainage was carried out, and its reduction in average SOC stock in deeper soil had been much less (only 2.85MgCha-1 at 20-40cm soil depth).  In both the Nicaraguan and Costa Rican experiments during the first nine years of coffee and tree establishment, SOC stocks in 20-40cm depth soil generally decreased (and this also occurred in 10-20cm depth soil in Costa Rica, giving an average loss over 10-40cm of 12.1MgCha-1).  The contrasts within the ANOVA for 0-10cm soil depth SOC stock changes for Costa Rica further support the findings of the mixed effect models, showing a significantly greater increase in SOC stock in the organic than the conventional management treatments (p=0.0001) (Fig. 3).  This is further supported by the significant differences in SOC stock changes between the treatments with pruned and un-pruned trees in Costa Rica, though all treatments showed a huge contrast in trends of SOC stock with soil depth between an increase at 0-10cm and a decrease at 20-40cm.  The results of the present study showed that coffee production systems under organic management increased SOC stocks in the top 10cm of soil more than did conventional production systems in Costa Rica (with a highly significant ANOVA test result), but not in Nicaragua.  In Nicaragua no significant differences in changes of SOC stock between the organic and conventional treatments were detected for any soil depth.  In Nicaragua, similar to the results in Costa Rica, in the top 10cm of soil there was an increase in mean SOC stock for every shade treatments (average 1.26MgCha-1 or 2.8%) (Fig. 2 and Table S2).  The specific objectives were to investigate (a) how the addition and management of trees in agricultural systems change total SOC stocks through the soil profile and (b) how agronomic management affects SOC stocks in comparison with the effects of the trees.  The direction of change in SOC stocks varied with soil depth in a similar way between the two countries.  Especially in the organic systems, which have additional organic matter inputs in the form of manures and coffee pulp, the climate change mitigation potential of the gains in SOC stock in the 0-10cm depth soil equate to an average of 1.45MgCO2eha-1year-1 in Costa Rica and 0.88MgCO2eha-1year-1 in Nicaragua, both of which lie well within the range of estimated non-CO2 GHG emissions from soil resulting from the inputs of organic matter.  In fact, we found a nine-year decrease in SOC stocks over 0-40cm depth by an average, across all shade types, of 9.99MgCha-1 (12.4%) in Costa Rica, whereas in Nicaragua (where the long-term land use before the experiment had been the same as afterwards, shaded coffee) there was a much smaller decrease in average 0-40cm depth SOC stock of 0.2MgCha-1 (0.14%).  In the present study, the plots with initially higher SOC stocks tended to have greater SOC losses (or smaller gains) during the observed period of coffee system establishment, notwithstanding the major difference between them in shade tree and coffee management treatments (Figs.  In addition, the penetration of roots into the deeper soil, and thereby the deposition of C at that depth (which showed the greatest decrease in SOC stocks) would have been delayed during the establishment of the new trees and coffee bushes.  Across the treatments there were differences in trend of SOC stocks amongst the soil depths in both countries.\n",
      "SOC stocks decreased by 12.4% in Costa Rica and 0.13% in Nicaragua after establishment of coffee AFS.  SOC stocks increased in the top 10cm of soil; greater reduction occurred at 20-40cm.  Organic management caused a greater increase in 0-10cm SOC but did not influence reduction at depth.  Shade type effects on SOC were smaller; no significant difference between shaded and unshaded coffee.  SOC stocks tend to converge on a level determined by site environment during establishment.  Current carbon accounting methodologies often assume interactions between above-ground and below-ground carbon, without considering effects of land management.  We used data from two long-term coffee agroforestry experiments in Costa Rica and Nicaragua to assess the effect on total soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks of (i) organic versus conventional management, (ii) higher versus moderate agronomic inputs, (iii) tree shade types.  During the first nine years of coffee establishment total 0-40cm depth SOC stocks decreased by 12.4% in Costa Rica and 0.13% in Nicaragua.  Change in SOC differed consistently amongst soil layers: at 0-10cm SOC stocks increased by 2.14 and 1.26MgCha-1 in Costa Rica and Nicaragua respectively; however much greater reduction occurred at 20-40cm (9.65 and 2.85MgCha-1 respectively).  Organic management caused a greater increase in 0-10cm SOC but did not influence its reduction at depth.  Effects of shade type were smaller, though heavily pruned legume shade trees produced a greater increase in 0-10cm SOC than unpruned timber trees.  No significant differences in SOC stocks were found between shaded and unshaded systems at any depth and SOC was poorly correlated with above-ground biomass stocks highlighting poor validity of \"expansion factors\" currently used to estimate SOC.  SOC stock changes were significantly negatively correlated with initial SOC stock per plot, providing evidence that during establishment of these woody-plant-dominated agricultural systems SOC stocks tend to converge towards a new equilibrium as a function of the change in the quantity and distribution of organic inputs.  Therefore it cannot be assumed that tree-based agricultural systems necessarily lead to increases in soil C stocks.  While high inputs of organic fertiliser/tree pruning mulch increased surface-layer SOC stocks, this did not affect stocks in deeper soil, where decreases generally exceeded any gains in surface soil.  Therefore site- and system-specific sampling is essential to draw meaningful conclusions for climate change mitigation strategies.\n",

      "Summary for Sink or source-The potential of coffee agroforestry systems to sequester atmospheric CO2 into soil organic carbon: In order to develop an automation process to expand hiPSC using CompacT SelecT, the hiPSC line was transferred to the Centre for Biological Engineering (CBE), Loughborough University where it was further cultured and passaged in T25 flasks using the manual protocol established at LRM (Brons et al., 2007).  The changes made in the four versions of the automated protocol were based on: (a) the time for the colonies to settle down by gravity after washing, (b) the distance of the pipette from the bottom of the flask when removing diluted enzyme solution without aspirating the cells clumps, (c) the pipetting speed and number of mixing steps required to achieve an homogeneous cell suspension of the desirable cell clump size without the presence of an undue number of single cells, and (d) the split ratio (Table 2).  For many manual cell culture protocols, there is a centrifugation step to concentrate the cell suspension and allow for cells to be washed.  At Loughborough University, the CompacT SelecT has been successfully used to culture many different cell types including human mesenchymal cells and human embryonic stem cells (hESC) (Thomas et al., 2007, 2009a,b).  In conclusion, we have successfully demonstrated a protocol passaging hiPSC in an automated system, the CompacT SelecT, with cells maintained as aggregates.  It proved difficult to use the CEDEX cell counter to count clumps of cells in order to passage cells based on cell count as the CEDEX could not count the clumps accurately (data not shown).  Automation would most certainly benefit from development of (conical) plastic vessels of the volume necessary to accommodate cell suspensions from T175 flasks as this could reduce the time for cell clumps to settle and thus speeding the passaging protocol.  Thus this platform can be used to expand and differentiate batches of cells to a tighter specification than manual cell culture (Liu et al., 2010).  The CompacT SelecT (The Automation Partnership, UK) is a fully automated cell culture platform which incorporates a small six-axis anthropomorphic robotic arm (Cell Therapy Manufacturing Facility, 2011) that can access 90 T175 flask and plate incubators, controlled at 37°C under an atmosphere of 5% (v/v) CO2 and humidity.\n",
      "First published protocol for scalable automation of hiPSC in feeder-free conditions.  Successful transfer of hiPSC between sites representative of research and manufacture.  Comparability between manual and automated expansion protocols for hiPSC.  The transfer of a laboratory process into a manufacturing facility is one of the most critical steps required for the large scale production of cell-based therapy products.  This study describes the first published protocol for scalable automated expansion of human induced pluripotent stem cell lines growing in aggregates in feeder-free and chemically defined medium.  Cells were successfully transferred between different sites representative of research and manufacturing settings; and passaged manually and using the CompacT SelecT automation platform.  Modified protocols were developed for the automated system and the management of cells aggregates (clumps) was identified as the critical step.  Cellular morphology, pluripotency gene expression and differentiation into the three germ layers have been used compare the outcomes of manual and automated processes.\n",

      "Summary for Investigating the feasibility of scale up and automation of human induced pluripotent stem cells cultured in aggregates in feeder free conditions: Under drought stress, the transgenic plants displayed vigorous growth while the wild-type plants shed most of their leaves and produced less root biomass [153] (see Section 9 for a description of these genes).  This gene may be useful for plants destined for K+-deficient soils.  This may be a key gene for improvement of photosynthesis in C3 trees.  This gene may be useful in conifers, which normally do not have genes for syringyl lignin.  However, these plants performed poorly from a biomass perspective, so other genes may be more useful for this purpose.  Similarly, hybrid aspen (P. tremula×P. tremuloides) plants expressing the rolABC genes showed little seasonal variation in growth, whilst the wild type plants exhibited winter dormancy [52] (Table 1).  Transgenic poplar over-expressing both chit1 and AMP2 were significantly more resistant to A. alternata than single gene transformants and wild-type trees [177].  In the growth chamber, the transgenic plants grew faster (∼40% greater height increment, 25% more radial growth in 30 days) and they had larger leaves that were 30% heavier (dry weight) than wild-type plants [108].  Such plants would presumably benefit from co-transformation with (CBF/DREB)1-like genes.  Over-expression of GSH1, the gene for γ-GLUTAMYLCYSTEINE SYNTHETASE, in poplar led to poor growth, but the lines with the lowest transgene activity displayed increased growth (height and weight) and better photosynthetic rates than the wild-type plants [81].  Significantly, the transgenic plants showed higher sylleptic branching, a trait associated with high biomass yield in poplar [5].  The transgenic plants had increased wood density but the transgene had no effect on the growth phenotype [103].  Conversely, over-expression of F5H, the gene encoding FERULATE 5-HYDROXYLASE in hybrid poplar (P. tremula×P. alba), generated plants with normal growth phenotypes that produced wood with an increased proportion of syringyl units and improved pulping efficiency [117].  Hence, it is prudent to generate transgenic trees that have an array of resistance genes for use against known pests.\n",
      "Increasing forest biomass has significant economic and environmental impact.  Many forestry objectives, e.g., more biomass, are best attained by transgenesis.  Transgenes enable plants to display one or a few traits for biomass applications.  Multi-trait engineering can generate a superior tree expressing most desired traits.  Biomass is a prime target for genetic engineering in forestry because increased biomass yield will benefit most downstream applications such as timber, fiber, pulp, paper, and bioenergy production.  Transgenesis can increase biomass by improving resource acquisition and product utilization and by enhancing competitive ability for solar energy, water, and mineral nutrients.  Transgenes that affect juvenility, winter dormancy, and flowering have been shown to influence biomass as well.  Transgenic approaches have increased yield potential by mitigating the adverse effects of prevailing stress factors in the environment.  Simultaneous introduction of multiple genes for resistance to various stress factors into trees may help forest trees cope with multiple or changing environments.  We propose multi-trait engineering for tree crops, simultaneously deploying multiple independent genes to address a set of genetically uncorrelated traits that are important for crop improvement.  This strategy increases the probability of unpredictable (synergistic or detrimental) interactions that may substantially affect the overall phenotype and its long-term performance.  The very limited ability to predict the physiological processes that may be impacted by such a strategy requires vigilance and care during implementation.  Hence, we recommend close monitoring of the resultant transgenic genotypes in multi-year, multi-location field trials.\n",

      "Summary for Potential transgenic routes to increase tree biomass: Neither the HSQ film thickness nor the surface topography/roughness can be reliably measured without metallization.  For the 3-D optical profiler measurements on surfaces coated with the cured HSQ films it was necessary to sputter a thin layer of a reflective film in order to characterize roughness of HSQ coated surfaces.  In conclusion, we have been able to show that a relatively thin HSQ film on metallic substrates such as molds for injection molding is able to greatly to decrease surface roughness.  Samples that have been spray-coated with HSQ and cured show considerably reduced roughness as shown in Fig. 1.  To increase reflectance of the HSQ film and to avoid light transmission and reflection from the metal substrate, we sputter coated cured HSQ samples with a thin film of gold/palladium (80/20) alloy.  A soft HSQ film reflows to achieve the minimal surface area.  Therefore we sputtered thin reflective films not only on HSQ coated samples but also on silicon wafer samples, to verify the topography change due to the sputtering of a reflective film.  This finally allows surface topography measurement on HSQ coated substrates using a 3-D optical profilometer, as shown in Fig. 4.  The bottom row shows profiles of same surfaces coated with a cured HSQ film.  We see substantial decrease of roughness on the HSQ coated samples; approximately 10 times for a sample with initially higher roughness and 3 times for a sample with initially lower roughness.  We can also directly see a low roughness top surface, with islands and voids of metal from a deposition of a reflective film.  Half of sample area was masked with cleanroom blue tape, and therefore not coated with HSQ.  Hence, HSQ only reflects approximately 2.4-2.7% of incident light, assuming perpendicular incidence and no roughness.  Patterned HSQ surfaces have previously been used as nanoimprint lithography masters [19].  However, if we thermally cure a smooth, virtually solvent free film at an elevated temperature, it fully cross-links and forms a hard coating with a substantially reduced roughness, compared to the starting roughness of the metal substrate.\n",
      "Spray-coated silsesquioxane coating can be applied to planar and non-planar surfaces.  Cured coating sustains in excess of 10,000 molding cycles.  The peak-to-valley roughness is decreased 10 to 20 times.  Good agreement between mechanical (AFM) and optical (VSI) methods.  Surface roughness or texture is the most visible property of any object, including injection molded plastic parts.  Roughness of the injection molding (IM) tool cavity directly affects not only appearance and perception of quality, but often also the function of all manufactured plastic parts.  So called \"optically smooth\" plastic surfaces is one example, where low roughness of a tool cavity is desirable.  Such tool surfaces can be very expensive to fabricate using conventional means, such as abrasive diamond polishing or diamond turning.  We present a novel process to coat machined metal parts with hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) to reduce their surface roughness.  Results from the testing of surfaces made from two starting roughnesses are presented; one polished with grit 2500 sandpaper, another with grit 11.000 diamond polishing paste.  We characterize the two surfaces with AFM, SEM and optical profilometry before and after coating.  We show that the HSQ coating is able to reduce peak-to-valley roughness more than 20 times on the sandpaper polished sample, from 2.44(±0.99)μm to 104(±22)nm and more than 10 times for the paste polished sample from 1.85(±0.63)μm to 162(±28)nm while roughness averages are reduced 10 and 3 times respectively.  We completed more than 10,000 injection molding cycles without detectable degradation of the HSQ coating.  This result opens new possibilities for molding of affordable plastic parts with perfect surface finish.\n",

      "Summary for Surface roughness reduction using spray-coated hydrogen silsesquioxane reflow: In conclusion, our results suggest that acid/alkaline phosphatase activity in the rhizosphere of Cyclopia and Aspalathus species growing in the low-P soils of the Cape fynbos can be used as a predictor of P supply and P assimilation in the rhizosphere of those legumes.  While these high P concentrations in shoots of Cyclopia species could be attributed to P enzyme activity in the rhizosphere, it is well documented that N2-fixing legumes generally accumulate greater mineral nutrients in their organs than cereals (Broadley et al., 2003; Fageria, 2004; Pedersen et al., 2002).  The data showed that acid phosphatase activity was again higher in the rhizosphere soils of C. subternata compared to bulk soil (Table 3).  The greater acid/alkaline phosphatase activity also resulted in changes in soil organic P. As the activity of soil phosphatases increased (Table 2), there was a marked and significant decrease in rhizosphere organic P compared to the bulk soil, and a decrease in rhizosphere organic P of older plants compared to their younger counterparts (Table 2).  As described before, this was done using bioassays of P enzyme activity in rhizosphere soils, as well as P in shoots of tea plants.  The marked differences in acid phosphatase between bulk and rhizosphere soil of C. genistoides and C. subternata led to further field tests that compared the enzyme activity of C. genistoides with two Aspalathus species and the non-legume Mimetes cucullatus at Koksrivier.  The greater acid phosphatase activity in the rhizosphere of older Cyclopia plants also resulted in increased Pi supply in the rhizosphere of older compared to younger plants (Table 2).  Whatever the case, the greater P assimilation by C. genistoides, C. subternata, A. caledonensis and A. aspalathoides over non-legumes at Koksrivier and Kanetberg could suggest that, for these legume species endemic to the low-P fynbos environment, rhizosphere acid/alkaline phosphatase activity is potentially a good measure of P availability.  Our data therefore suggest that the increase in acid/alkaline phosphatase activity in the rhizosphere of Cyclopia resulted in greater inorganic P supply from organic sources relative to bulk soil, where there was low P enzyme activity, and therefore low P concentration.  Organic P levels however were greater in non-rhizosphere bulk soil compared to rhizosphere of C. genistoides established in 1997 (Table 2).  Is the expression of acid/alkaline phosphatase activity different in the rhizosphere of cuttings and seedlings of Cyclopia species?  However, the cuttings showed much greater plant-available inorganic and organic P concentration in rhizosphere soil than seedlings (Table 4).  Rhizosphere soil of C. subternata established in 1999 showed significantly greater acid and alkaline phosphatase activity to that grown in 2002 (Table 3).  The data again revealed markedly high acid phosphatase enzyme activity in the rhizosphere than bulk soil, and in the rhizosphere of older than younger C. subternata plants.\n",
      "Cyclopia and Aspalathus species are important economic legumes in the Cape fynbos of South Africa, as they are used for making Honeybush and Rooibos tea, and for trade in the cut wild flower industry.  The aim of this study was to assess acid and alkaline phosphatase activity in the rhizosphere of Cyclopia genistoides, Cyclopia subternata, Aspalathus caledonensis and Aspalathus aspalathoides as an indicator of P supply and P nutrition in the nutrient-poor soils of the Cape fynbos.  Whether at Kokrivier or Kanetberg, the P enzyme activities were much higher in the rhizospheres of the legumes C. genistoides, C. subternata, A. caledonensis, and A. aspalathoides compared to those of the non-legumes Leucadendron strictum, Elegia thyrsoidea and Mimetes cucullatus, or bulk soil.  As a result, plant-available P concentration in the rhizosphere, as well as shoot P levels closely mirrored acid and alkaline phosphatase activity in the rhizosphere of each plant species.  Relative to younger plants, older Cyclopia species exhibited, much greater acid and alkaline phosphatase activity in the rhizosphere and this again resulted in much higher plant-available rhizosphere P. C. subternata plants developed from cuttings at Kanetberg showed greater rhizosphere acid and alkaline phosphatase activity than seedlings and bulk soil.  As a result, the concentration of plant available-P and organic P were much higher in the rhizosphere of cuttings than seedlings, leading to greater shoot P in cuttings than seedlings.  Taken together, these data suggest that rhizosphere P enzyme activity can be used as a good indicator of P supply and P nutrition in Cyclopia cuttings and seedlings, but less so in Aspalathus species in the Cape fynbos.  The enhanced P nutrition in plants from cuttings probably accounts for the higher tea yields obtained by farmers when they use cuttings instead of seedlings in their plantations.  We measured acid and alkaline phosphatase activity in rhizosphere soils relative to bulk soils of fynbos legumes.  We concurrently measured P levels in rhizosphere and shoots.  We found significantly higher acid/alkaline phosphatase activity in rhizosphere soils relative to non-rhizosphere bulk soils.  Acid and alkaline activity increased with age of Cyclopia plants.  Plants developed from cuttings increased acid/alkaline phosphatase activity over seedlings.\n",

      "Summary for Rhizosphere acid and alkaline phosphatase activity as a marker of P nutrition in nodulated Cyclopia and Aspalathus species in the Cape fynbos of South Africa: Fig. 4 shows the AFM images and corresponding 3D profiles of SiC wafer, CDC layer and dual-layer film, indicating surface morphology evolution in the process.  The XPS measurements were carried out aiming to determine the surface composition and chemical nature for SiC, CDC layer and dual-layer film, as demonstrated in Fig. 3.  The surface microstructures of the CDC layer and the dual-layer film are also investigated by FESEM as shown in Fig. 5.  As a result, the dual-layer carbon film composed of sub-layer of CDC and top layer of CVD carbon was synthesized.  Surface analysis of the CDC layer reveals that it does not consist purely of carbon, but that it still contains O, Si and Cl components.  The dual-layer film is composed of a CDC layer formed by chlorination of SiC and a CVD layer formed by pyrolyzing the CCl4 at high temperature.  Since the CVD carbon nucleates and grows on the top of CDC layer, top layer may copy the structure of CDC layer in some extent and therefore their Raman feature is similar.  The surface atomic concentration of Cl in the CDC layer by XPS analysis is about 5.5at.%.  As the CDC layer is formed by selective etching of Si from SiC, the surface is characterized of a highly porous structure mainly consisted of numerous nanoscale pores and a corresponding large specific area of the CDC layer (Fig. 5a).  Additionally, the dual-layer film shows advantages over the CDC layer in friction reduction.  Since the CDC layer results from selective etching of Si atoms in SiC by Cl2, some of the Cl2 is likely retained in the CDC layer in atomic or bonded form [22].  Fig. 2 presents the Raman spectra of SiC substrate, CDC layer, and dual-layer film to investigate the structure evolvement.  Differently, the friction coefficients of the CDC layer and the dual-layer film against steel ball are higher than Si3N4.\n",
      "It is reported that a dual-layer carbon film on SiC wafer is prepared using carbide-derived carbon (CDC) process with subsequent chemical vapor deposition (CVD).  The dual-layer film includes a sub-layer of CDC and a top layer of CVD, which are prepared by chlorination of SiC and pyrolysis of CCl4 at high temperature respectively.  The CDC and CVD layers are mainly amorphous.  And similar dispersion effects are observed in the Raman spectra, although the D-band position of the CVD layer shifts to higher wavenumber (~1354cm-1) than that of the CDC layer (~1337cm-1).  Surface chemistry analysis suggests that the unstable chemical bonds, mainly C-Cl, as well as dangling bonds in the CDC layer play an important role in promoting the nucleation of CVD carbon.  The surface morphology evolvement from SiC wafer to CDC layer and to dual-layer film is investigated by atomic force microscopy [AFM] and field emission scanning electronic microscopy [FESEM].  The nanoporous surface formed in the CDC process is favorable for capturing carbon species from the gas phase and can act as a \"seedbed\" for the nucleation and growth of CVD layer.  The primary tribological study indicates that the dual-layer film shows great advantages in friction reduction and wear resistance with comparison to SiC and CDC layer, suggesting its potential in lubrication for SiC-based moving components.  The dual-layer carbon film is prepared using CDC process with subsequent CVD method.  The surface of the CDC layer is highly porous in structure and chemically active.  The CDC layer acts as a seedbed layer for the nucleation and growth of the CVD layer.  The dual-layer film is tested as an effective lubricating coating for SiC components.\n",

      "Summary for Preparation and characterization of a dual-layer carbon film on 6H-SiC wafer using carbide-derived carbon process with subsequent chemical vapor deposition: This study reports the effect of glyphosate on M. phaseolina in vitro and the effect of glyphosate on the population dynamics of M. phaseolina (colony forming units) collected from infected soybean in the field.  This is in agreement with the finding of Mengistu et al. (2008) that colony forming units in soybean tissue were greater under conventional tillage than under no-till when two applications of glyphosate at 0.84 kg a.i/ha were applied.  It has been established that the optimal temperature for M. phaseolina growth in culture is 30 °C (Mengistu et al., 2007).  When relating the glyphosate tested in vitro to what was used in the field, the concentrations of glyphosate required for inhibition are well beyond what would be applied under field conditions.  At both test locations, glyphosate treatments were: 1) glyphosate at 0.84 kg a.i/ha applied at V3 (third trifoliate); 2) glyphosate at 0.84 kg a.i/ha applied at V6 (sixth trifoliate); 3) glyphosate at 0.84 kg a.i/ha applied twice at V3 and V6; and 4) a no glyphosate applied (control).  The estimates of CFU of M. phaseolina following glyphosate treatment at each location are shown in Fig. 3.  The reason as to why the CFU levels were reduced at V3 and V6 rather than when applied twice at V3 and V6 in MS indicates that multiple applications of glyphosate may result in soybean injury and inhibition of soybean nodules causing stress to the crop (Reddy and Zablotowicz, 2003).  glycines (Sanogo et al., 2000) with increasing concentrations of glyphosate herbicide (Kawate et al., 1992).  These CFU levels in TN were not significantly different (P ≤ 0.05) from each other.  To test if glyphosate has any effect on M. phaseolina, it is necessary to conduct both in vitro and field studies.  The radial growth with Gly-K salt showed little variation at various glyphosate concentrations and temperatures in comparison to GlyCry.  The lower CFU values in TN may be due to soybean planting in no-till as opposed to planting in tilled soil as in MS.  Most of the research examining the effect of herbicides, including glyphosate, on disease development in soybean has been limited to greenhouse and laboratory studies (Anderson and Kolmer, 2005; Feng et al., 2005) and did not include application timing under different environments (Harikrishnan and Yang, 2001; Meriles et al., 2006).\n",
      "Laboratory and field studies were conducted to assess the effects of glyphosate on Macrophomina phaseolina culture growth in vitro and the disease severity of charcoal rot in soybean fields at Stoneville, MS and Jackson, TN.  Glyphosate inhibited M. phaseolina growth in a linear dose dependent manner when technical grade glyphosate acid (GlyCry) was used; however, growth was inhibited in an exponential dose dependent manner when a commercial formulation of glyphosate-potassium salt (Gly-K salt) was used.  The glyphosate GR50 values (glyphosate concentration required to cause a 50% reduction) in culture radial growth ranged from 0.25 to 9.94 mM among the M. Phaseolina isolates, temperatures, and formulations.  The three isolates differed in response to various concentrations across the three temperature regimes.  Among the three isolates, TN 410 was the most sensitive for both GlyCry (GR50 = 7.74 mM) and Gly-K salt (GR50 = 0.25 mM) at 30 °C.  This research indicates that glyphosate has the ability to inhibit growth of M. phaseolina in culture in vitro.  The preliminary field studies demonstrated that application of glyphosate to glyphosate-resistant soybeans did not enhance or reduce the severity of charcoal rot in a no-till field in TN but had some suppressing effect in a tilled environment in MS when single applications were made at growth stage V3 and V6.  Glyphosate effect on growth of Macrophomina phaseolina in culture and severity was assessed.  Glyphosate inhibited M. phaseolina in vitro.  Sensitivity to glyphosate concentrations differed between isolates.  Disease severity was not affected by Glyphosate application of no-till field.  Glyphosate had suppressing effect in tilled field under hot and dry conditions.\n",

      "Summary for Effect of glyphosate on Macrophomina phaseolina in vitro and its effect on disease severity of soybean in the field: Amigo et al. (2013) found that this tephra in the cores of ODP Site 1233 consists of two populations of shards, rhyodacitic and basaltic andesitic, but could not identify a source volcano for this tephra.  The SVZ has produced some of the largest explosive eruptions in recent history, most notably the 1932 Quizapu (Cerro Azul; M 6.0, >9.5 km3 tephra; Hildreth and Drake, 1992) and 1991 Cerro Hudson (M 5.8, 4-7 km3 tephra; Naranjo et al., 1993a) eruptions.  Surface accumulations of tephra are therefore almost exclusively preserved thanks to the presence of vegetation in or near the Andes, where tephra accumulation has only been possible since the time at which the ice sheet last retreated from the location (e.g., Menounos et al., 2013).  However, the compilation of tephra records in palaeoenvironmental archives of southern Chile and Argentina (Supplementary Table 2) shows that the vast majority of tephra layers are insufficiently characterised to allow the source to be identified.  However, correlations sometimes only rely on a rough age correspondence between distinctive tephra layers in different sections (e.g., Abarzúa et al., 2004; Lamy et al., 2004).  Even larger eruptions are known to have occurred in the SVZ during the Pleistocene (e.g., the Diamante caldera-forming event, Maipo; M 7.7, ∼270-350 km3 tephra: Sruoga et al., 2005; Stern et al., 1984b).  Chemical alteration is a particularly significant issue with tephra preservation in peat bogs, cores or sections through which are the most common source of tephra samples in southernmost Patagonia/from the AVZ (Supplementary Table 2; Stern, 2008).  Some care is required to distinguish peaks in cryptotephra concentration representing primary fallout from those reflecting tephra remobilisation (Swindles et al., 2013), which is possible even in distal locations, where the tephra can be sourced from erosion of the peat bogs themselves (e.g., Swindles et al., 2013).  Some of the best preserved tephra can be found in lake and marine sediment cores: significant chemical alteration and erosion of deposited tephra is uncommon in these environments, but the thickness of and grain size in tephra layers may not be representative of primary fallout.  From the tephra dispersal patterns presented in Fig. 2 it is clear that tephra from the majority of the large eruptions is dispersed eastward.  Remobilisation of tephra layers by turbidites (Moernaut et al., 2007; Bertrand et al., 2008a) is common; reworked layers can be difficult to distinguish from primary fallout, with implications for correlation and constraints of eruption frequency (Wastegård et al., 2013; Van Daele et al., in press).  Appropriate tephra characterisation can potentially also help in evaluating the reservoir effect in a sediment section by providing a tie-point in the age model, provided the age of the tephra is well known from one or more independent sources (e.g., 14C dating on charcoal incorporated in terrestrial deposits, for example the well-constrained 3.00-3.05 ka cal BP Alpehué Pumice (So-A) eruption from Sollipulli; Supplementary Table 1; Naranjo et al., 1993b).  Supplementary Table 2 summarises all of the known tephra occurrences in sediment sections in southern Chile and Argentina, predominantly in lacustrine, marine and peat cores.  Unless a name was already given to a specific tephra horizon in literature, all tephra horizons are given a unique name consisting of the (abbreviated) core or location name followed by the central depth of the tephra in the sediment core.\n",
      "The Southern and Austral Volcanic Zones of the Andes comprise 74 volcanic centres with known post-glacial activity.  At least 21 of these have had one or more large explosive eruptions in the late Quaternary, dispersing tephra over vast areas.  These tephra layers therefore have great potential as tephrochronological marker horizons in palaeoenvironmental studies in southern Chile and Argentina, a region that is particularly useful to study climate dynamics of the southern hemisphere.  However, to date tephrochronology has rarely been fully utilised in this region as a correlation and dating tool.  Here we review the existing post-glacial tephrostratigraphic record of the Southern and Austral Volcanic Zones, and compile a database of known occurrences of tephra from these volcanoes in ice and lacustrine, marine, peat, and cave sediment records.  We address the inconsistencies in and revisions of the tephrostratigraphies presented in prior literature, and discuss the challenges in correlating tephras and the limitations of the tephrostratigraphic record in this area.  This study highlights the many gaps that still exist in our knowledge of the eruptive histories of these volcanoes, but also reveals the largely under-utilised potential of tephra as a correlation tool in this region.  This is exemplified by the severe lack of adequate geochemical analysis of tephra layers preserved in many lacustrine and peat sediment sections, which are particularly important tephrostratigraphic records in southern Chile and Argentina due to the paucity of surface preservation.  Review of the post-glacial tephrostratigraphy in southern Chile/Argentina.  Identify 29 potential regional marker tephra units from 21 volcanoes.  Present database of tephra occurrences in palaeoenvironment records from the region.  Describe challenges in correlation of tephra units in the region.

      "Summary for Late Quaternary tephrostratigraphy of southern Chile and Argentina: Upon loading with H2 (0.25 H2/Al and 0.50 H2/Al) at 40-50K, the background of the INS spectra increases due to the recoil of the H2 molecules, and a broad hump is observed at low energy transfers (<30meV) confirming uptake of H2 by NOTT-300 (Fig. 3(b)).  The peak at 8.8meV in the spectra for NOTT-300·nH2 (n=0.5,1.0) in this study is entirely consistent with the INS peak (10meV) observed for MOF-5, confirming that the adsorbed H2 molecules in NOTT-300 are interacting with [Al(OH)2O4] moieties (Fig. 4).  We report herein the application of the in situ inelastic neutron scattering (INS) technique to permit direct observation of the dynamics of the binding interactions between adsorbed H2 molecules and an aluminium-based porous MOF, NOTT-300, exhibiting moderate porosity, narrow pore window and very low uptake of H2.  However, INS studies of carbon materials show that the phenyl ring only forms weak interactions with adsorbed H2 molecules, resulting in a small splitting or shift in the 14.7meV rotational line.  Thus, comparison of the INS spectra suggests that adsorbed H2 molecules have very weak interactions to the NOTT-300 host and, therefore, can rotate freely in the channel to give recoil rotational motion.  [Al(OH)2O4] moieties within the channel can only provide binding interactions to few H2 molecules and reach saturation quickly consistent with the experimentally observed low H2 uptake for this material.\n",
      "Metal-organic framework (MOF) materials show promise for H2 storage and it is widely predicted by computational modelling that MOFs incorporating ultra-micropores are optimal for H2 binding due to enhanced overlapping potentials.  We report the investigation using inelastic neutron scattering of the interaction of H2 in an ultra-microporous MOF material showing low H2 uptake capacity.  The study has revealed that adsorbed H2 at 5K has a liquid recoil motion along the channel with very little interaction with the MOF host, consistent with the observed low uptake.  The low H2 uptake is not due to incomplete activation or decomposition as the desolvated MOF shows CO2 uptake with a measured pore volume close to that of the single crystal pore volume.  This study represents a unique example of surprisingly low H2 uptake within a MOF material, and complements the wide range of studies on systems showing higher uptake capacities and binding interactions.\n",

      "Summary for Inelastic neutron scattering study of binding of para-hydrogen in an ultra-microporous metal-organic framework: Our main result is that the Hausdorff dimension of any efficient set in Rp is no more than p-1.  Thus, since Hausdorff, showing that a set has Lebesgue measure zero has simply raised a more basic problem, namely that of finding the appropriate dimension in which to then measure the set.  By Lemma 1.2, the translation of an efficient set is efficient; by Theorem 3.4 the translation (a degenerate bi-Lipschitz map) leaves unchanged the set's Hausdorff dimension.  As argued in the Introduction, finding that a set has Lebesgue measure zero for finite p is a challenge to find the correct dimension in which to measure the set.  Section 2 proves that efficient sets in Rp have p-dimensional Lebesgue measure zero.  Thus, Jordan's conjecture can be settled if the elements identified by the theorem can be bounded: the isolated allocations, as countable sets, have measure and dimension zero; Theorems 2.1 and 3.2 bound the indifferent allocations; the balance of power loci have not yet been bounded.  Section 3 introduces Hausdorff dimension and proves that efficient sets have dimension no more than p-1.  A stable set,SinAhasm(n-1)-dimensional measure zero.\n",
      "We introduce efficient sets, a class of sets in Rp in which, in each set, no element is greater in all dimensions than any other.  Neither differentiability nor continuity is required of such sets, which include: level sets of utility functions, quasi-indifference classes associated with a preference relation not given by a utility function, mean-variance frontiers, production possibility frontiers, and Pareto efficient sets.  By Lebesgue's density theorem, efficient sets have p-dimensional measure zero.  As Lebesgue measure provides an imprecise description of small sets, we then prove the stronger result that each efficient set in Rp has Hausdorff dimension at most p-1.  This may exceed its topological dimension, with the two notions becoming equivalent for smooth sets.  We apply these results to stable sets in multi-good pillage games: for n agents and m goods, stable sets have dimension at most m(n-1)-1.  This implies, and is much stronger than, the result that stable sets have m(n-1)-dimensional measure zero, as conjectured by Jordan.\n",

      "Summary for Efficient sets are small: We validated and accredited the arsenic speciation method for rice.  We also assessed total and inorganic arsenic levels in long grain rice and rice-based baby food products on the Finnish market.  In this category, rice is one of the main contributors to the inorganic arsenic intake due to its high level of total arsenic.  Some assessments of the inorganic arsenic intake from long grain rice and baby food can be made (Table 4).  The total arsenic content of rice based baby food products was 0.09mg/kg on average (n=10), ranging from 0.02 to 0.29mg/kg (Table 3) and arsenic species in rice based baby foods were the same as in long grain rice (DMA, As(III), As(V)).  In general the total and inorganic arsenic contents of rice-based baby food are lower than the levels in long grain rice.  No certified reference materials are available for inorganic arsenic species of rice.  In this article we describe a fully validated method for the determination of total and inorganic arsenic in rice.  However, with respect to arsenic intake the way of cooking significantly contributes to the arsenic intake originating from rice (Mihucz et al., 2007).  The arsenic species detected in the rice samples were DMA, As(III) and As(V).  There are commercially available rice or other cereal based reference materials which have a certified value for total arsenic level not for the distinct inorganic arsenic or arsenic species.  In the arsenic speciation analysis arsenobetaine (AB) (Fluka Analytical, Italy), arsenic(III)oxide (As(III)) (Aldrich Chemistry, USA), dimethyl arsenic acid (DMA) (Chem Service, USA), monomethyl arsenic acid disodium salt (MMA) (Argus Chemicals, Italy) and arsenic(V) (As(V)) standard solution (Merck, Germany) were used.\n",
      "Inorganic arsenic was determined in long grain rice and rice-based baby food samples.  The inorganic arsenic intake from one source is close to the lowest BMDL0.1 value.  The cumulative intake assessment of inorganic arsenic is needed.  We evaluated total and inorganic arsenic levels in long grain rice and rice based baby foods on Finnish market.  Inorganic arsenic was analysed with an HPLC-ICP-MS system.  The total arsenic concentration was determined with an ICP-MS method.  In this study, the inorganic arsenic levels in long grain rice varied from 0.09 to 0.28mg/kg (n=8) and the total arsenic levels from 0.11 to 0.65mg/kg.  There was a good correlation between the total and inorganic arsenic levels in long grain rice at a confidence level of 95%.  The total arsenic levels of rice-based baby foods were in the range 0.02 - 0.29mg/kg (n=10), however, the level of inorganic arsenic could only be quantitated in four samples, on average they were 0.11mg/kg.  Our estimation of inorganic arsenic intake from long grain rice and rice-based baby food in Finland indicate that in every age group the intake is close to the lowest BMDL0.1 value 0.3μg/kg bw/day set by EFSA.  According to our data, the intake of inorganic arsenic should be more extensively evaluated.\n",

      "Summary for The intake of inorganic arsenic from long grain rice and rice-based baby food in Finland - Low safety margin warrants follow up: Whilst the regeneration of holly and oak were recorded infrequently (<20% of sites), relatively high regeneration densities were recorded at specific sites for these species (for example, 723stems/ha in the case of oak).  We have explored the regeneration density of native broadleaved species on clearfelled conifer sites in upland Britain.  We addressed the following questions: (i) How well do native tree species regenerate on clearfelled upland conifer plantations? (ii) How does regeneration on clearfelled conifer plantations compare to regeneration on improved farmland and open moorland? (iii) What are the dominant factors controlling regeneration? (iv) How does the ground flora develop in the years following clearfelling and how does this impact tree regeneration?  The diversity of regenerating species was usually lower than that of the adjacent seed sources with regeneration dominated by birch on all but one clearfelled site, as has been found previously at storm damaged lowland sites in Britain (Harmer and Morgan, 2009; Harmer et al., 2011) and elsewhere in Europe (Degen et al., 2005).  The linear regression of time since clearfelling on regeneration density of native species was not found to be significant (r2=0.26, n.s.).  However, the regeneration of native species on clearfelled conifer plantations is still poorly understood (Zerbe, 2002) with Wallace (1998)'s study of birch regeneration in clearfelled spruce plantations the only previous study in upland Britain.  Table 3 shows the density of regeneration for native species and the fraction of clearfelled sites where each species was recorded.  The density of birch regeneration on clearfelled upland moorland on our study sites is similar to that recorded in a storm damaged lowland conifer site in Britain (Harmer and Morgan, 2009) and to clearfelled upland conifer sites in Scotland (Wallace, 1998).  The mean density of regeneration of native species on clearfelled sites varied from 0stems/ha to >5000stems/ha (Table 2).  Regeneration was dominated by birch and rowan.  Nevertheless, the regeneration density on clearfelled upland moorland sites and a clearfelled PAWS site (5790stems/ha) exceeded the suggested sapling stocking densities for new native woodland in Britain of between 500 and 2000stems/ha (Forestry Commission, 2010).  No significant relationship between plant cover and regeneration density was seen for any species.  The regeneration density of birch and alder was found to be negatively correlated with distance from seed source (see Table 4).  Here we report the first extensive study of natural regeneration of native hardwood species on clearfelled upland conifer plantations in Britain.\n",
      "We examine native tree regeneration on clearfelled conifer plantations.  Mean regeneration density exceeded 1000stems/ha and was dominated by birch.  Regeneration is increased by the absence of ground flora after clearfelling.  Proximity to a wind-dispersed seed source increased natural regeneration.  Brash piles reduced regeneration density.  In upland areas of Great Britain, large tracts of non-native conifer plantations have been established on poor quality agricultural land.  There is now considerable interest in the conversion of some of these plantations to a more natural woodland comprised of native tree species.  We studied the tree regeneration and ground flora on 15 upland sites (altitudes ranging from 120m to 380m above sea level) that had been clearfelled of conifers.  Regeneration of native tree species was successful where a clearcut site was adjacent to mature native trees, which acted as a seed source.  Mean regeneration densities of native tree species on clearcut sites were typically greater than 1000stems/ha, exceeding minimum recommended planting densities for the establishment of new native woodland.  Whilst 10 native woody tree species were recorded, the regeneration was dominated by birch species.  Regeneration densities were significantly higher on clearcut sites than on adjacent areas of unplanted moorland, probably due to the lack of a dense ground flora following the clearfelling operations.  Our results indicate that where local native seed sources exist, clearfelling upland conifer plantation sites to allow natural regeneration has the potential to be an effective method of establishing native woodland.\n",

      "Summary for Regeneration of native broadleaved species on clearfelled conifer plantations in upland Britain: For example, for the 1.3mm sand-rough beach measurements were possible down to 1mm flow depth.  For example, at the time of maximum backwash velocity on the 1.3mm sand-rough beach at x=0.772m, the velocity increases from zero at the bed to -1.8m/s at the surface within a depth of 25mm.  (For reference, friction factors calculated assuming steady and uniform flow and evaluated from the measured depths and velocities, with equivalent roughness of 1.3mm and 8.4mm, are consistently higher for the rougher beach by approximately 50%.) The fact that the friction factors are not very different in the present experiments suggests that the high flow unsteadiness and non-uniformity of swash have significant influence on the bed shear stress for a given instantaneous velocity.  In the backwash, the flow depth decreases rapidly and the flow velocity increases (until it reaches the maximum backwash velocity).  The measurements for the location seaward of the beach, x=-1.802m, echo the depth measurements for the same location (Fig. 9): for all 3 beaches the u¯ time-series are nearly identical for the majority of the uprush period and are similar during the backwash, with u¯ time series for the 1.3mm sand-rough beach lagging slightly behind the other two.  Maximum swash flow depth decreases with increasing distance from the initial shoreline, which means that a smaller flow area needs to be measured for locations further up the beach slope, with consequent increase in accuracy of the velocity measurement.  The longer time gap between the time of bore arrival and the first velocity measurement explains why maximum uprush velocity at x=0.072m appears to be lower than the maximum uprush velocity at locations higher up the beach.  There is very little variability in the depth-averaged velocity results up to the time of maximum backwash velocity, after which the relatively small flow depths and high velocities cause high levels of bed-generated turbulence throughout the flow column.  Maximum uprush velocity is higher than maximum backwash velocity (although the actual maximum uprush velocity is not measured here because of the delay already described), the flow decelerates during the final stage of the backwash when the bed friction exceeds the driving force.  The flow accelerates in the backwash until it reaches a maximum backwash velocity when the retarding force due to bed friction balances the driving force due to the slope component of weight of water on the beach.  Differences in depth-averaged velocities between beaches of different roughness become significant only at the late stages of backwash, when flow over a rougher slope achieves lower (in absolute value) maximum velocity and starts to decelerate earlier than flow over a smoother slope.  Fig. 11 also shows the times of flow reversal (based on the ensemble-averaged depth-averaged velocity time-series, Fig. 12) at the five PIV measurement locations on the beach.\n",
      "A detailed experimental investigation of the hydrodynamics of large-scale, bore-driven swash on impermeable, rough beach slopes is described.  The experiments were carried out on 1:10 impermeable, rough slopes with three different surface roughnesses based on 1.3mm sand, 5.4mm gravel and 8.4mm gravel.  The large-scale discrete swash event was produced by the collapse of a dambreak-generated bore on the beach.  Simultaneous depths and velocities were measured using LIF, Laser-induced fluorescence, and PIV, particle image velocimetry, respectively, yielding better resolution of the hydrodynamics than previous studies.  Depth time-series, instantaneous velocity profiles, depth-averaged velocities, instantaneous turbulent kinetic energy profiles, depth-averaged turbulent kinetic energy, Reynolds stress profiles and bed shear stresses are presented for five cross-shore measurement locations in the swash.  The measurements resolve the backwash shoreline position, and the late backwash period when depths are shallow and velocities are high.  The detailed data can be used to test and develop advanced numerical models for bore-driven waves on rough slopes.  ►Detailed hydrodynamics of bore-driven swash on impermeable, rough slopes.  ►Large-scale laboratory experiments measuring simultaneous depths and velocities.  ►Shows effects of slope roughness on bulk flow and turbulence properties.  ►Yields measures of time-varying bed shear stress across the swash zone.\n",

      "Summary for Experimental study of bore-driven swash hydrodynamics on impermeable rough slopes: Bore-driven swash on unsaturated coarse-grained beaches generates several interacting physical processes: surface flow over the beach face, infiltration into the initially unsaturated part of the beach, air entrapment below the wetting front (Steenhauer et al., 2011a) and groundwater flow.  Furthermore, air entrapment between the wetting front and the groundwater surface increases pore-air pressure and hence creates a horizontal pressure gradient which induces air flow as well as groundwater flow in the shoreward direction (Steenhauer et al., 2011a).  If the hydraulic head at the beach surface is greater than the hydraulic head within the confined region of the beach, the surface flow recharges groundwater and q is positive.  The vertical flux into the confined groundwater cell is driven by the difference in hydraulic head at the beach surface, Hih, and at the upper boundary of groundwater flow, Hiη.  In the uprush (Fig. 1, top panel) the surface water covers the beach surface so the 'piston' extends between the beach surface and the wetting front (a sharp boundary between the saturated and the unsaturated zones within the beach).  In the 1.5mm beach the groundwater levels were not affected during the swash event, because the wetting front did not reach the groundwater within the swash cycle, due to the low permeability of the beach.  The system of equations for the groundwater module is combined into a linear system expressed for one computational cell i as:(23)Ki-1/2wa1Hi-1η,n+1-(Ki-1/2wa1+Ki+1/2wa2+a4)Hiη,n+1+Ki+1/2wa2Hi+1η,n+1=-B1+B2where the individual coefficients of system (23) for the confined and unconfined region of the beach are given as:(24)a1=hiη,n+hi-1η,n2Δxa2=hiη,n+hi+1η,n2Δxa3=Δxzib-zica4={Kiwa3:Iteration1for confined beach(Darcy flux forq)0:Iteration2for confined beach(Forchheimer law forq)θΔxΔt:Unconfined beachB1=Ki-1/2Wa1Hi-1η,n-(Ki-1/2Wa1+Ki+1/2Wa2)Hiη,n+Ki+1/2Wa2Hi+1η,nB2={-Kia3[(WHih,n+wHih,n+1)-WHiη,n]:Iteration1forconfinedbeach-Δxqi:Iteration2forconfinedbeacha4(-pia,n+1ρg-Hiη,n+pia,nρg):Unconfinedbeachwhere 0≤w≤1 denotes the weighting coefficient, where W=(1-w), Hiη is the hydraulic head within the beach in cell i, for the unconfined region of the beach Hiη=hiη+piaρg, hiη is the height of the groundwater in cell i, pia is the air pressure within the unsaturated cell i, ρ is the density of water, g is the gravitational acceleration, Hih is the hydraulic head at the level of the bed based on the surface flow (Hih=zib+hih+pAρg), pA is the atmospheric pressure and qi is the vertical flux expressed in Eq. (20).  Position of cell s varies with time, as the confined part of the beach becomes longer when the wetting front reaches the groundwater further in the beach (Fig. 15).  Trial values for the saturated thickness, hf,n*, and for the height of the groundwater level, hη,n*, are predicted based on the updated surface flow depth, hn+1, and the pore-air pressure in the unsaturated region of the beach, pa,n, at the previous time-level, tn.  The filtration module solves for the corrected value of saturated thickness, hf,n+1 (and thus wetting front and tail level zf,n+1 and zt,n+1), and the vertical volume flux qn+1, with the hydraulic gradient calculated from the updated surface water depth, hn+1, and air pressure within the unsaturated region of the beach, pa,n+1.  Flow through the entire confined region (from the toe of the beach until the most shoreward confined cell, s, Fig. 15) is evaluated using the average horizontal hydraulic gradient across the beach and the Darcian approximation of flow resistance.  They are mainly generated by the increased surface water levels at the lower end of the beach directly recharging groundwater flow.  The swash model of Steenhauer et al. (2011b) simulating the movement of a steep bore over a permeable coarse-grained beach and the movement of the wetting front within the beach has been extended to include the behaviour of air entrapment and groundwater.\n",
      "The paper presents a numerical model for bore-driven swash on permeable coarse-grained beaches.  The surface flow module is modelled using the non-linear shallow water equations (NLSWEs), solved using the Godunov-based finite volume ADER scheme, which is suitable for handling steep bores as well as large source terms in the NLSWEs.  The subsurface flow comprises: (i) infiltration and exfiltration modelled as vertical piston-like flow, (ii) horizontal pore-air movement within the unsaturated region of the beach, (iii) the horizontal groundwater flow.  Model predictions of the surface and subsurface flow are in good agreement with measurements from large-scale laboratory experiments for swash on permeable, immobile beaches.  In these simulations air velocity was sufficiently small to justify using Darcy's resistance law for the air flow, whereas the quadratic Forchheimer law had to be used for the infiltration and groundwater flow.  The validated numerical model provides insight into the surface-subsurface water exchange for bore-driven swash on coarse-grained beaches.  The impact of air entrapped between the wetting front and the groundwater level on the water exchange is examined in particular.  ► We model key mechanisms of the water exchange between swash and subsurface.  ► Focus is on filtration and pore-air pressure build-up within the unsaturated beach.  ► Validation is carried out with measurements from large-scale laboratory experiments.  ► Swash model is consistent with experimental results on two coarse-grained beaches.  ► The insights contribute to better understanding and modelling of key swash processes.\n",

      "Summary for Numerical model of swash motion and air entrapment within coarse-grained beaches: In order to verify the need to retain terms up to O(μ2) and O(εμ2) in variable depth power expansion and the term related to the approximation to the second order of the vertical vorticity in the Boussinesq equations, the numerical results obtained with the FNBE scheme are compared with the results obtained with the NBE scheme.  Figs. 2 and 3 show the comparison between computed and measured time-averaged wave heights as the waves propagate up the slope respectively for test cases 1 and 2: the computed values are obtained by using Madsen's equations, Nwogu's equations and the proposed fully non-linear Boussinesq model.  As the weak solutions of the integral form of the motion equations (numerically solved by a shock-capturing scheme) are able to directly simulate wave breaking, the explicit introduction in the equations of terms representing the breaking wave dissipation is not necessary.  Figs. 4 and 5 show the comparison between measured and computed values of the mean water level respectively for test cases 1 and 2: the computed values are obtained by using Madsen's equations, Nwogu's equations and the proposed fully non-linear Boussinesq model.  In this paper an integral form of the fully non-linear Boussinesq equations in contravariant formulation has been proposed in which Christoffel symbols are avoided in order to simulate wave transformation phenomena, wave breaking and nearshore currents in computational domains representing the complex morphology of real coastal regions.  In this paper a new integral form of the fully non-linear Boussinesq equations in contravariant formulation is proposed in order to simulate wave evolution, wave breaking and breaking-induced nearshore currents in computational domains representing the complex morphology of real coastal regions.  In all the tests, simulations are carried out by switching from Boussinesq equations to non-linear shallow water equations when the wave height to water depth ratio is equal to 0.8, according to Tonelli and Petti (2012) and Shi et al. (2012).  In Fig. 10 is shown the comparison between the spatial evolution of the spectra obtained from the numerical simulations and those presented by Beji and Battjes (1993) for a breaking wave (test D of Table 2).  Shi et al. (2012) followed the Tonelli and Petti (2009) approach in modelling wave breaking: the Boussinesq equations switched into the non-linear shallow water equations where the Froude number exceeds a certain threshold.  2 and 3 it can be noted that, for both test cases, the wave heights computed with the proposed fully non-linear model are in a better agreement with the experimental data in the shoaling region, at the breaking point and in the surf zone where wave energy decays.  The fully non-linear Boussinesq equations expressed in a conservative form in a two-dimensional Cartesian system as a function of the dependent variables H and r→ are:(2)∂H∂t+∇⋅r→=-∇⋅s→(3)∂r→∂t+∇⋅r→⊗r→H+GH∇η=-r→H∇⋅s→-HV→+T→+W→-R→where ⊗ is the tensor product between vectors, G is the constant of gravity, V→ and T→ are the dispersive terms obtained by retaining terms up to O(μ2) and O(εμ2) in depth power expansions of the horizontal velocity according to Wei et al. (1995a), W→ is the term related to the approximation to the second order of the vertical component of the vorticity according to Chen(2006) and R→ is the bottom resistance term.  The equations resulting from neglecting the above-mentioned terms are accurate only up to O(μ2), do not include the term related to the approximation to the second order of the vertical vorticity and are consistent with the Boussinesq equations proposed by Nwogu (1993) in a Cartesian reference system.  The comparison between the computed wave heights obtained using the Nwogu's equations and those obtained using the proposed fully non linear Boussinesq model shows the importance of retaining terms up to O(εμ2) in variable depth power expansion.\n",
      "In this paper we propose an integral form of the fully non-linear Boussinesq equations in contravariant formulation, in which Christoffel symbols are avoided, in order to simulate wave transformation phenomena, wave breaking and nearshore currents in computational domains representing the complex morphology of real coastal regions.  Following the approach proposed by Chen (2006), the motion equations retain the term related to the approximation to the second order of the vertical vorticity.  A new Upwind Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory scheme for the solution of the fully non-linear Boussinesq equations on generalised curvilinear coordinate systems is proposed.  The equations are rearranged in order to solve them by a high resolution hybrid finite volume-finite difference scheme.  The conservative part of the above-mentioned equations, consisting of the convective terms and the terms related to the free surface elevation, is discretised by a high-order shock-capturing finite volume scheme in which an exact Riemann solver is involved; dispersive terms and the term related to the approximation to the second order of the vertical vorticity are discretised by a cell-centred finite difference scheme.  The shock-capturing method makes it possible to intrinsically model the wave breaking, therefore no additional terms are needed to take into account the breaking related energy dissipation in the surf zone.  The model is verified against several benchmark tests, and the results are compared with experimental, theoretical and alternative numerical solutions.  We propose a contravariant formulation of the fully non-linear Boussinesq equations.  The presented contravariant formulation is free of Christoffel symbols.  The equations retain the approximation to the second order of the vertical vorticity.  We present a new Upwind Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory scheme.

      "Summary for An integral contravariant formulation of the fully non-linear Boussinesq equations: Under Sadoré conditions, most experimental varieties (EVs) derived from the genepool in 2008 (3rd selection cycle) or 2009 (4th selection cycle) present better resistance to Striga and downy mildew than the genepool parental population, except EV09-Cin (for ASNPC), EV08-Sad-SP and EV09-Comb (for DM) (Table 3).  Five cycles of phenotypic recurrent selection in a diversified pearl millet genepool resulted in significant improvement for Striga and downy mildew resistance, and increased panicle yield.  In total, this genepool was subjected to five cycles of recurrent selection, and provides a unique opportunity to examine the effectiveness of recurrent selection for improving Striga and downy mildew resistance, and yield performance in cultivated pearl millet.  Under Sadoré conditions, the mean of the full-sib families (FS) created from the C5 selection cycle was significantly lower (P<0.01) than the mean of the genepool parents (Parent) for both Striga resistance (ASNPC: -51%) and downy mildew incidence (DM: -46%) (Table 3).  Whether the observed gains in Striga resistance with selection in the pearl millet Striga-resistant genepool are due to these or other mechanisms is yet to be determined.  The genepool was kept open, so that potentially interesting landraces (reported by farmers to be Striga resistant) were included as test entries during the evaluation cycles (all four-replicate field trials), and if above-average Striga resistance and acceptable yield performance was proven, the landrace was included in the FS and S1 creation for the next selection cycle.  Similarly, significant selection gains were observed at Cinzana for panicle yield (+31%) and downy mildew incidence (-62%), but not for Striga resistance, where the C5-FS mean for area under Striga number progress curve was only 1% lower than the Parent group, and the observed difference was statistically non-significant.  To date, increased resistance to Striga through recurrent selection has not been reported for pearl millet.  Under both sites, the Control group supported the highest Striga damage and lowest panicle yield, while its performance was better at Sadoré for downy mildew resistance compared to the genepool parental means (Table 3).  Predicted gainscycle-1 for Striga resistance (recorded on the area under Striga number progress curve) were -572, -81 and -122 for Sadoré, Cinzana and across the two sites, respectively, and ranged from -3% to -6% for downy mildew incidence (Table 4).  In the first and subsequent cycles, selection was based on the following criteria: above-average Striga resistance [i.e.  According to our knowledge, this is the first report describing significant progress from recurrent selection for quantitative Striga resistance in pearl millet.  The lower measured response from selection for Striga resistance at Cinzana may be attributed to the following factors:-  The average realized percentage gain from selection for Striga resistance (ASNPC) was -10%cycle-1 at Sadoré and -0.3%cycle-1 at Cinzana, downy mildew susceptibility decreased by 9%cycle-1 at Sadoré and 21%cycle-1 at Cinzana.  In the present study, marked predicted responses were estimated for all target traits, suggesting that enhanced Striga and downy mildew resistance, as well as increased panicle yield are expected also in the next cycle of selection.  High panicle yield was significantly but only weakly associated with resistance to Striga (coefficient of correlation r=-0.38** and -0.15*) and downy mildew (r=-0.34** and -0.22**) for Sadoré and Cinzana, respectively.  Since 2006, the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) in Niger, in partnership with the national agricultural research program in Mali (Institut d'Economie Rurale, IER), has conducted recurrent selection in a diversified pearl millet genepool to increase frequencies of desirable alleles for Striga and downy mildew resistance and panicle yield using two test sites in West Africa (Sadoré in Niger and Cinzana in Mali).\n",
      "A Striga-resistant genepool was developed in West African cultivated pearl millet.  We examine the response of the diversified genepool to five cycles of selection.  Selection significantly increased panicle yield, Striga and downy mildew resistance.  The observed genetic variation and heritabilities enable further selection gains.  The derived varieties will contribute to integrated Striga control in West Africa.  Striga hermonthica (Del.) Benth. is a persistent threat to pearl millet [Cenchrus americanus (L.) Morrone, comb.  nov.] production, especially in West Africa.  This study aimed at evaluating the response of a diversified pearl millet genepool to five cycles of recurrent selection targeting Striga resistance and panicle yield, and to a lesser extent downy mildew [Sclerospora graminicola (Sacc.) J.  Schroet.] resistance.  Two-hundred full-sib families (FS) representing the C5 selection cycle were evaluated together with the genepool parental landraces, experimental varieties derived from previous cycles and local checks in Striga-infested fields at Sadoré (Niger) and Cinzana (Mali).  Substantial and mostly significant selection progress could be documented.  The accumulated percentage gain from selection amounted to 51%/1% lower Striga infestation (measured by area under Striga number progress curve, ASNPC), 46%/62% lower downy mildew incidence, and 49%/31% higher panicle yield of the C5-FS compared to the mean of the genepool parents at Sadoré/Cinzana, respectively.  Experimental varieties selected from previous cycles also revealed lower ASNPC and mostly higher yield compared to genepool parents at their selection sites.  Significant genetic variation among the C5-FS and operative heritabilities of 76% (Cinzana), 84% (Sadoré) and 34% (combined across locations) for ASNPC will enable continued selection gain for Striga resistance.  High genotype×environment interaction variances for all target traits suggest that different experimental varieties need to be extracted from the genepool for different sites.  The genepool-derived varieties will be further validated on-farm and are expected to contribute to integrated Striga control in pearl millet in West Africa.\n",

      "Summary for Development of a pearl millet Striga-resistant genepool: Response to five cycles of recurrent selection under Striga-infested field conditions in West Africa: 4b, 5b) and the Orbulina Limestone (Fig. 4e, f) in the Decontra section (Bernoulli et al., 1992; Mutti et al., 1999; Vecsei and Sanders, 1999) as well as by two intervals of planktonic foraminiferal limestones in the Bryozoan Limestone.  The second depositional sequence begins with a monotonous succession of cross-bedded grainstones dominated by planktonic foraminifers, bryozoans, and echinoderms (Upper Bryozoan Limestone of Mutti et al., 1997, 1999) and ends with Orbulina-rich marls (Orbulina Marls sensu Mutti et al., 1997, 1999; Orbulina Limestone of Carnevale et al., 2011).  The Decontra carbon isotope record is assumed as a proxy for productivity and the δ13C maximum in the Bryozoan Limestone was correlated with the prominent middle Miocene carbon-isotope excursion (the so-called \"Monterey\" event) between ~17 and 13.5Ma (Mutti et al., 1999, 2006; Holbourn et al., 2007; Fig. 6B).  The deepening trend in the first depositional cycle of Mutti et al. (1997) (Lepidocyclina Limestone and Cerratina cherty Limestone) corresponds to the sea level rise from the beginning of the Chattian to the end of the Burdigalian.  Moreover, the age of the Lithothamnium Limestone is ambiguous (?Serravallian), because strontium isotope ages are inconsistent (Mutti et al., 1999).  The hemipelagic deposits in the upper part of the first and second depositional sequences (Orbulina Marls/Cerratina cherty Limestone, Orbulina Limestone) are wedge-shaped in cross-section and disappear toward the platform in the SE (Mutti et al., 1999).  Together with the previously reported late Tortonian age for the Lithothamnium Limestone (Merola, 2007; Carnevale et al., 2011), this age model reveals a strong coincidence of the shallow water carbon isotope record from Decontra with the global deep sea carbon isotope curve of Zachos et al. (2001).  According to the new carbon isotope stratigraphy, the transition Lepidocyclina Limestone-Cerratina cherty Limestone coincides with the highstand of the third-order eustatic cycle that follows on the Ch 4/Aq 1 sequence boundary of Hardenbol et al. (1998; Fig. 7).  This positive carbon isotope excursion predates the drowning of the Lepidocyclina Limestone ramp and coincides with the Mi-1 glaciation event in the global isotope record of Zachos et al. (2001) (Fig. 7).  The overlying Orbulina Limestone is constrained by the carbon isotope curve to the highstand of the third-order eustatic cycle that follows on the Ser 3 sequence boundary of Hardenbol et al. (1998; Fig. 7).  The Oligocene-Miocene Decontra section, at the northwestern platform margin, is a reference section for the correlation of Mediterranean shallow water deposits (Mutti et al., 1997, 1999, 2006; Brandano et al., 2010).  The herein presented carbon isotope trends conform to those published by Mutti et al. (1997, 1999) from the Decontra section (Fig. 6), which are considered to reflect a primary marine signature.\n",
      "Shallow-marine sediment records have the strong potential to display sensitive environmental changes in sedimentary geometries and skeletal content.  However, the time resolution of most neritic carbonate records is not high enough to be compared with climatic events as recorded in the deep-sea sediment archives.  In order to resolve the paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic changes during the Oligocene-Miocene transition in the Mediterranean shallow water carbonate systems with the best possible time resolution, we re-evaluated the Decontra section on the Maiella Platform (central Apennines, Italy), which acts as a reference for the correlation of Oligocene-Miocene shallow water deposits in the Mediterranean region.  The 120-m-thick late Oligocene-late Miocene carbonate succession is composed of larger foraminiferal, bryozoan and corallinacean limestones interlayered with distinct planktonic foraminiferal carbonates representing a mostly outer neritic setting.  Integrated multi-proxy and facies analyses indicate that CaCO3 and total organic carbon contents as well as gamma-ray display only local to regional processes on the carbonate platform and are not suited for stratigraphic correlation on a wider scale.  In contrast, new biostratigraphic data correlate the Decontra stable carbon isotope record to the global deep-sea carbon isotope record.  This links relative sea level fluctuations, which are reflected by facies and magnetic susceptibility changes, to third-order eustatic cycles.  The new integrated bio-, chemo-, and sequence stratigraphic framework enables a more precise timing of environmental changes within the studied time interval and identifies Decontra as an important locality for correlating not only shallow and deep water sediments of the Mediterranean region but also on a global scale.  We establish a new age model for the Oligo-Miocene Decontra section.  The local carbon isotope record is correlated with the global δ13C curve.  This correlates Mediterranean shallow water records with oceanic/climatic events.\n",

      "Summary for Correlating Mediterranean shallow water deposits with global Oligocene-Miocene stratigraphy and oceanic events: Despite the lack of a bioturbated, mixed surface sediment layer, we must invoke a paleomagnetic lock-in depth of approximately 21-34cm in Gyltigesjön's sediments to obtain the best fit to FENNOSTACK (Snowball et al., 2007).  We compared our paleomagnetic data from the Gyltigesjön sediment sequence to the Fennoscandian paleomagnetic master curves for direction and intensity produced by Snowball et al. (2007).  Through modelling of the effect of different lock-in depths, which takes into account changes in sediment accumulation rate, and statistical comparison to the regional PSV reference curves we are able to provide a minimum estimate of the paleomagnetic lock-in depth in Gyltigesjön sediments, which have magnetic properties consistent with an assemblage dominated by non-interacting single-domain magnetite magnetosomal magnetite.  The visual matches between the Gyltigesjön paleomagnetic data and the reference curves for zero and 21cm lock-in depths are shown in Fig. 11.  One of the preconditions to the formation of varved sediments is the absence of crawling or burrowing fauna and, therefore, it can be expected that a paleomagnetic lock-in depth, if present, would be determined by sediment consolidation and/or the location where magnetic grains of biogeochemical origin are produced.  The results of regressing the Gyltigesjön data against FENNOSTACK and FENNORPIS (Snowball et al., 2007), with the application of different lock-in depths, are shown in Fig. 10.  This system provided four overlapping cores for paleomagnetic reconstructions to a sediment depth of 8m (GD0a, GP1, GP2 and GP4.  It is acknowledged that stable single-domain magnetite grains, often magnetosomal, contribute to the magnetic properties of lacustrine and marine sediments (e.g. Snowball, 1994; Roberts et al., 2011), but very little is known about the depth at which the NRM is locked in, which leads to uncertainties in the ages of paleomagnetic features, including RPI.  Another, related, aspect of marine and lacustrine sediments that affects the paleomagnetic lock-in depth is the influence of burrowing or crawling benthic fauna, which cause the top part of a sediment column to be mixed to the extent that no net magnetic remanence can be acquired by this layer.  The Gyltigesjön sediment sequence has relatively constant sediment density and organic carbon content, and small changes in the concentration of remanence carrying materials of uniform magnetic grain size (single-domain magnetite).  There are, however, distinct changes in magnetic susceptibility within GU-3, which also contains a distinct layer of clastic sediment (approximately 1mm thick) with high magnetic susceptibility at depth of 5.16m.  They did, however, detect the Roman (~AD1) peak in atmospheric lead pollution (Renberg et al., 2001) at a sediment depth of 3.5m, which would represent an average sediment accumulation rate of 1.75mm/a for the last 2000years.\n",
      "We studied the paleomagnetic properties of relatively organic rich, annually laminated (varved) sediments of Holocene age in Gyltigesjön, which is a lake in southern Sweden.  An age-depth model was based on a regional lead pollution isochron and Bayesian modelling of radiocarbon ages of bulk sediments and terrestrial macrofossils, which included a radiocarbon wiggle-matched series of 873 varves that accumulated between 3000 and 2000 Cal a BP (Mellström et al., 2013).  Mineral magnetic data and first order reversal curves suggest that the natural remanent magnetization is carried by stable single-domain grains of magnetite, probably of magnetosomal origin.  Discrete samples taken from overlapping piston cores were used to produce smoothed paleomagnetic secular variation (inclination and declination) and relative paleointensity data sets.  Alternative temporal trends in the paleomagnetic data were obtained by correcting for paleomagnetic lock-in depths between 0 and 70cm and taking into account changes in sediment accumulation rate.  These temporal trends were regressed against reference curves for the same region (FENNOSTACK and FENNORPIS; Snowball et al., 2007).  The best statistical matches to the reference curves are obtained when we apply lock-in depths of 21-34cm to the Gyltigesjön paleomagnetic data, although these are most likely minimum estimates.  Our study suggests that a significant paleomagnetic lock-in depth can affect the acquisition of post-depositional remanent magnetization even where bioturbation is absent and no mixed sediment surface layer exists.  Paleomagnetic data obtained from organic rich varved lake sediments.  Chronology based on 14C wiggle-matching and 14C ages of terrestrial macrofossils.

      "Summary for An estimate of post-depositional remanent magnetization lock-in depth in organic rich varved lake sediments: We have identified the causative mutation to be in MRPL12, encoding a protein of the large subunit of mitochondrial ribosome.  In order to determine whether the MRPL12 mutation also induced changes in composition and assembly of the mitochondrial ribosomal large and small subunits, mitochondrial lysates from cultured fibroblasts (subject and control) were fractionated on isokinetic sucrose gradients (10-30%, as in Ref.  Thus the reduced levels of mutant MRPL12 in this subject correspond to i) loss of stability, ii) a decrease in the free pool that is believed to interact with the mitochondrial RNA polymerase and iii) reduced translation potentially resulting from decreased interactions with translation factors, but with no detectable increase in aberrant translation products.  Although there was an overall decrease in mitochondrial translation compared to control, densitometric profiles showed that certain polypeptides were more affected than others (Fig. 6).  To identify any effect on global mitochondrial protein synthesis, we studied de novo mitochondrial translation in cultured skin fibroblasts, as described in Ref.  Since the levels of small and large subunit proteins appeared to be similar in subject and control, these data suggest that the mt-LSU and 55S assembly are unaffected by the mutation consistent with the gradient data for the protein and RNA components.  These were modestly decreased with levels of ~60-80% of control (Fig. 4A and B).  Overall levels in the subject sample were decreased to 63% of control value (Fig. 5B) but distribution in the gradient appeared largely unaffected with the exception of fraction 11, where levels were lower than control (Fig. 5A bottom panels).  Both complexes I and IV, detected by anti-GRIM19 antibody or mitochondrially-encoded COXI, were severely decreased in the subject, which in contrast exhibited control levels of complex II (70kDa SDHA subunit) and complex III (Core 2 subunit) (Fig. 1B).  The steady state level of MRPL12 in the subject's fibroblasts was reduced to 30% of control value (Fig. 4A and B).  Correspondingly, 16S and 12S rRNA levels were decreased by 35% and 22% respectively (Fig. 7A).  Relatively few cases of OXPHOS deficiencies associated with mutations in mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs) have been described so far.  Genes encoding mitochondrial proteins were selected in Mitocarta [43].  The MRPL12 mutation impacted more modestly on the small ribosomal subunit, with DAP3 apparently unaffected and MRPS18B found in lower amounts only in fractions 4 and 5 but otherwise with similar steady state levels and distribution profile compared to control.\n",
      "Multiple respiratory chain deficiencies represent a common cause of mitochondrial diseases and are associated with a wide range of clinical symptoms.  We report a subject, born to consanguineous parents, with growth retardation and neurological deterioration.  Multiple respiratory chain deficiency was found in muscle and fibroblasts of the subject as well as abnormal assembly of complexes I and IV.  A microsatellite genotyping of the family members detected only one region of homozygosity on chromosome 17q24.2-q25.3 in which we focused our attention to genes involved in mitochondrial translation.  We sequenced MRPL12, encoding the mitochondrial ribosomal protein L12 and identified a c.542C>T transition in exon 5 changing a highly conserved alanine into a valine (p.Ala181Val).  This mutation resulted in a decreased steady-state level of MRPL12 protein, with altered integration into the large ribosomal subunit.  Moreover, an overall mitochondrial translation defect was observed in the subject's fibroblasts with a significant reduction of synthesis of COXI, COXII and COXIII subunits.  Modeling of MRPL12 shows Ala181 positioned in a helix potentially involved in an interface of interaction suggesting that the p.Ala181Val change might be predicted to alter interactions with the elongation factors.  These results contrast with the eubacterial orthologues of human MRPL12, where L7/L12 proteins do not appear to have a selective effect on translation.  Therefore, analysis of the mutated version found in the subject presented here suggests that the mammalian protein does not function in an entirely analogous manner to the eubacterial L7/L12 equivalent.  MRPL12 function is not entirely analogous to the eubacterial L7/L12 equivalent.  Mutations in MRPL12 cause translation defects.  Mutations in apparently universal translation factors can affect different OXPHOS complexes.\n",

      "Summary for Mutations in mitochondrial ribosomal protein MRPL12 leads to growth retardation, neurological deterioration and mitochondrial translation deficiency: Although the FARS2 mutant cells showed a reduction in steady state levels of both complex IV subunits and mt-tRNAPhe, no significant decrease was observed in the de novo synthesis of mitochondrial proteins (Fig. 3E).  The distribution of the mitochondrial reticulum appeared normal in patient cells compared to controls.  The mitochondrially-encoded COXI and COXII subunits of complex IV were normal in patient fibroblasts but decreased in patient myoblasts when compared to age-matched controls (Fig. 3C).  To determine whether the FARS2 mutations led to impaired mitochondrial protein synthesis, we next evaluated the incorporation of 35S-methionine/cysteine into de novo synthesised mitochondrial proteins in patient myoblasts, compared to age-matched control cells.  To investigate if the FARS2 mutation in the patient cells was responsible for compromised mt-tRNA aminoacylation efficiency, we assessed in vitro aminoacylation activity of a recombinant FARS2 protein engineered to carry the identical p.Asp325Tyr missense mutation as observed in our patient.  To investigate if the FARS2 mutation in the patient cells was responsible for compromised mt-tRNA aminoacylation efficiency, we assessed in vitro aminoacylation activity of a recombinant FARS2 protein engineered to carry the identical p.Asp325Tyr missense mutation as observed in our patient.  As predicted, wild type FARS2 protein showed high levels of ATP binding in contrast to the mutant p.Asp325Tyr FARS2 protein, which showed no detectable ATP binding (Fig. 5B).  As predicted, wild type FARS2 protein showed high levels of ATP binding in contrast to the mutant p.Asp325Tyr FARS2 protein, which showed no detectable ATP binding (Fig. 5B).  In our patient, the respiratory chain complex IV deficiency was observed in both mature muscle and myoblasts but not in patient fibroblasts; this is not unprecedented and has been observed in other mt-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase defects including YARS2 [11].  In our patient, the respiratory chain complex IV deficiency was observed in both mature muscle and myoblasts but not in patient fibroblasts; this is not unprecedented and has been observed in other mt-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase defects including YARS2 [11].  This was also consistent with the complex IV deficiency observed in the patient's muscle biopsy, the decreased steady state levels of COXI and COXII protein expression in myoblasts and in the reduced steady-state levels of the mt-tRNAPhe transcript.  As expected this activity was ATP dependent (Fig. 5A).\n",
      "Mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) are essential enzymes in protein synthesis since they charge tRNAs with their cognate amino acids.  Mutations in the genes encoding mitochondrial aaRSs have been associated with a wide spectrum of human mitochondrial diseases.  Here we report the identification of pathogenic mutations (a partial genomic deletion and a highly conserved p.  Asp325Tyr missense variant) in FARS2, the gene encoding mitochondrial phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase, in a patient with early-onset epilepsy and isolated complex IV deficiency in muscle.  The biochemical defect was expressed in myoblasts but not in fibroblasts and associated with decreased steady state levels of COXI and COXII protein and reduced steady state levels of the mt-tRNAPhe transcript.  Functional analysis of the recombinant mutant p.  Asp325Tyr FARS2 protein showed an inability to bind ATP and consequently undetectable aminoacylation activity using either bacterial tRNA or human mt-tRNAPhe as substrates.  Lentiviral transduction of cells with wildtype FARS2 restored complex IV protein levels, confirming that the p.Asp325Tyr mutation is pathogenic, causing respiratory chain deficiency and neurological deficits on account of defective aminoacylation of mt-tRNAPhe.  The tissue specific variation in presentation of aaRS mutations is discussed.  A further clinical presentation of a FARS2 defect.  Molecular mechanism of FARS2 defect is characterised in vitro.\n",

      "Summary for Mutation of the human mitochondrial phenylalanine-tRNA synthetase causes infantile-onset epilepsy and cytochrome c oxidase deficiency: Transmittance measurements of annealed 15nm and 125nm thick AALD ZnO films on glass are shown in Fig. 6.  The AALD ZnO coated substrates were heated at 120°C for 10min and 150μL of the P3HT:PCBM blend was then spin-coated on the films at 600rpm for 6s, followed by 1000rpm for 60s.  In this work, we studied AALD ZnO as the hole blocking layer in the following device architecture: glass/ITO/AALD ZnO/P3HT:PCBM/MoO3/Ag.  From Fig. 3a, it can be seen that the blend has very good contact with the AALD ZnO layer to the extent that there was no delamination even after fracturing for cross-sectional SEM.  The high transmittance of visible light by the AALD ZnO films is also consistent with the JSC of the best device being comparable with the highest values from literature.  By comparing Fig. 3c with 3d (bare ITO), it can be seen that the AALD ZnO film was also conformal to the ITO substrate, since the topography of the ITO can still be seen in the 80nm thick AALD ZnO film.  AALD ZnO films are therefore highly suited as multifunctional components for inverted BHJ devices.  On the other hand, these unannealed AALD ZnO films are suitable for making flexible, plastic substrate solar cells.  The device parameters (VOC, JSC, PCE and FF) were found to be fairly constant for AALD ZnO films with a thickness of 40nm or more (Fig. 4a-c).  The as-grown AALD ZnO films of this work had two orders of magnitude higher electron mobility of 3.4+0.1cm2/Vs, which is consistent with the high compactness of the films.\n",
      "A thin ZnO (<200nm) film grown by Atmospheric Atomic Layer Deposition (AALD) in a matter of minutes was studied as a hole-blocking layer in poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-buyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) based inverted solar cells.  These AALD ZnO layers were compact, had a high electron mobility of 3.4+0.1cm2/Vs, had up to 100% transmittance to visible light, and a good wettability for the blend.  Despite the very rapid, open atmosphere growth method, the cell performance was comparable with some of the best inverted bulk heterojunction P3HT:PCBM cells in the literature.  The performance was also maintained after 200 days of storage in air in the dark.  ZnO was deposited in under 5min using Atmospheric Atomic Layer Deposition (AALD).  AALD is a fast, ambient method that is compatible with roll-to-roll processing.  The AALD ZnO was used as the hole blocking layer in organic solar cells.  The devices had performances comparable with the highest reported in literature.  The low-temperature deposited AALD ZnO can be used in plastic substrate solar cells.\n",

      "Summary for High performance inverted bulk heterojunction solar cells by incorporation of dense, thin ZnO layers made using atmospheric atomic layer deposition: In general, the best performance of the vacuum-deposited PTh:C60 devices, both before and after annealing, was found to peak between 40% and 60% PTh with devices showing efficiencies around 0.7%.  The XRD traces of the blended 1:1 PTh:C60 composition, shown in Fig. 4, confirm that there is no significant increase in PTh crystallinity upon annealing either.  Thermal annealing not only improves the photocurrent, but also increases Rsh of the devices (for 40-60% PTh) and subsequently enhances the values of Voc.  Development of the donor-acceptor network on annealing is driven by crystallization and re-arrangement of C60 on phase separation from the PTh [62-65].  Enhanced diode characteristics in light and dark curves, Fig. 2a (40-80% PTh), and decreasing series resistance Rs, Table 1 (40-60% PTh), are all consistent with the photocurrent increase.  The domains observed in the phase image of the PTh:C60 blends range from an average size of ∼30-35nm at low PTh content to larger ∼45-50nm for 60% PTh.  Even for large content of PTh (80%) the increase in roughness is only around 30%.  The enhanced charge generation demonstrated in the PTh:C60 devices shows that the BHJ network can be well-optimized for efficient exciton dissociation by annealing.  For 40-80% PTh, the network coarsens which could suggest phase separation within the blends.  This particular difference can, however, explain the decrease in Rsh of the 80% PTh devices taking place after annealing, as shown in Table 1.  In order to see the effect of annealing on different PTh:C60 compositions, optimization of the annealing temperature and time had to be performed.  The photovoltaic characteristics of PTh:C60 cells are comparable to PTh and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) BHJs processed in solution from thermo-cleavable precursors [52], and also to vacuum-deposited 6T:C60 devices [45].\n",
      "Bulk heterojunction solar cells made by vacuum co-evaporation of polythiophene (PTh) and fullerene (C60) are reported and the blend morphology control through donor-acceptor composition and post-situ annealing demonstrated.  Co-deposited heterojunctions are shown to generate about 60% higher photocurrents than their thickness-optimized PTh/C60 planar heterojunction counterparts.  Furthermore, by annealing the devices post-situ the power conversion efficiency is improved by as much as 80%.  UV-vis, XRD and AFM analysis shows that the enhanced photoresponse is a result of favorable morphological development of PTh upon annealing.  Annealing-induced improvement of the donor-acceptor network is demonstrated across a wide range of compositions (20-80% PTh).  This illustrates that good morphology control is possible in co-evaporated polymer-fullerene blends through multiple parameters and differentiates this donor-acceptor combination from the standard small-molecule systems.  Vacuum deposition of polymer/fullerene bulk heterojunction solar cells is reported.  Their performance is optimized through composition as well as post-situ thermal annealing.  Annealing enhances efficiency over a wide range of D:A blend compositions (1:4-4:1).  Improved blend morphology results from favorable phase separation of the polymer.  Morphology control in the polymer blend is superior to the equivalent oligomer blends.\n",

      "Summary for Morphology control in co-evaporated bulk heterojunction solar cells: There are a large number of performance studies reported, some with the aim of understanding the behaviour of a single type of device and some to compare the energy yields of different devices.  The losses in annual energy generation are even higher for the majority of devices, leading to difference between the lifetime specific energy yield of different devices as much as 25%, assuming 25 year warranties, the current standard.  The ageing of devices affects the energy yield significantly.  The other devices have a much more balanced behaviour in the course of the year, where different performance effects appear to balance.  To demonstrate the effects in device behaviour the outdoor data for 2009 was binned according to irradiance and temperature, as shown in Fig. 5 for two contrasting examples.  The effect of spectrum and annealing is clearly visible for the a-Si devices, while the behaviour of CIGS and c-Si devices is less affected by the seasons.  The degradation of the devices is, however, higher than the rest as apparent from Fig. 10.  The number of design parameters of thin film devices is larger and the production processes are less standardised than for c-Si, resulting in wide variation in the specific energy yield of modules of the same material technology.  It is demonstrated that when the energy yield of a module should be investigated either through modelling or through measurements, the long term behaviour can have a much more significant influence on the device productivity than the effect of the environment.  In the case of amorphous silicon devices, the device structure, number of junctions, material of the junctions as well as manufacturing can impact on the energy yield significantly [12,13].  It is shown that the effect of irradiance on device performance is largely due to device design, while the temperature and spectral response are dominated by the band gap and material quality of the absorber layer.  The temperature coefficient of a-Si devices tends to be smaller than that of CIGS and c-Si devices as a-Si has the highest band gap and thus will be affected the least according to Eq.  A c-Si example is chosen because the performance of these devices is generally more familiar.  The overall impact on annual energy yield is slightly positive for a-Si devices and virtually zero for the other technologies.  This difference in behaviour confirms the earlier point that the degrees of freedom in the design of thin film devices result in very different energy delivery of devices of the same technology.  The degradation of P700 is for most devices not so significant, most of the devices have not more than 0.65%/a degradation.  Thus, the relatively high temperature coefficient of c-Si does not affect the device performance as much as it would in other locations.  It is apparent from Fig. 7 that there is only a small spectral dependence for c-Si and CIGS devices.\n",
      "The energy yield delivered by different types of photovoltaic device is a key consideration in the selection of appropriate technologies for cheap photovoltaic electricity.  The different technologies currently on the market, each have certain strengths and weaknesses when it comes to operating in different environments.  There is a plethora of comparative tests on-going with sometimes contradictory results.  This paper investigates device behaviour of contrasting thin film technologies, specifically a-Si and CIGS derivatives, and places this analysis into context with results reported by others.  Specific consideration is given to the accuracy of module inter-comparisons, as most outdoor monitoring at this scale is conducted to compare devices against one another.  It is shown that there are five main contributors to differences in energy delivery and the magnitude of these depends on the environments in which the devices are operated.  The paper shows that two effects, typically not considered in inter-comparisons, dominate the reported energy delivery.  Environmental influences such as light intensity, spectrum and operating temperature introduce performance variations typically in the range of 2-7% in the course of a year.  However, most comparative tests are carried out only for short periods of time, in the order of months.  Here, the power rating is a key factor and adds uncertainty for new technologies such as thin films often in the range of 10-15%.  This dominates inter-comparisons looking at as-new, first-year energy yields, yet considering the life-time energy yield it is found that ageing causes up to 25% variation between different devices.  The durability of devices and performance-maintenance is thus the most significant factor affecting energy delivery, a major determinant of electricity cost.  The discussion is based on long-term measurements carried out in Loughborough, UK by the Centre for Renewable Energy Systems Technology (CREST) at Loughborough University.  The paper investigates the energy delivery of thin film photovoltaic devices in a maritime climate for amorphous silicon based modules and Copper -Indium, Gallium -DiSelenide based devices Effects on the energy delivery of thin film photovoltaics are separated and quantified.  Key contributors are measurement accuracy and changes in device behaviour with time rather than environment.  Effects of temperature, irradiance and spectrum are investigated and quantified.  The differences in long term ageing of different devices is quantified.\n",

      "Summary for Influences on the energy delivery of thin film photovoltaic modules: It is noted that the same fit parameters can be used to fit lifetime data from samples with a high bulk lifetime (low precipitate density) and low bulk lifetime (iron contaminated precipitates with a high density), which suggests that differences between surface recombination rates between samples are not substantial.  It is not possible to measure the interstitial iron concentration in n-type samples, so no correction is made for bulk iron-related recombination in such samples, and, besides which, the recombination activity of iron in n-type silicon is generally much less significant than in p-type silicon [45].  This, combined with previously published data on samples with a wider variety of precipitate concentrations [23], suggests that segregated iron determines the recombination activity of the strained oxide precipitates and surrounding defects.  By studying the injection-dependence of minority carrier lifetime as a function of doping level in both p-type and n-type silicon it has been possible to quantify recombination at oxide precipitates in terms of SRH statistics.  In Fig. 3, the residual minority carrier lifetime measured in uncontaminated samples containing oxide precipitates is plotted against X=n/p for two p-type specimens and Y=p/n for two n-type specimens.  (7)), so reductions in lifetime are assumed to be due to recombination associated with iron segregated to oxide precipitates and any surrounding defects (dislocations and stacking faults).  We therefore conclude that at least some of the recombination activity of oxide precipitates in \"uncontaminated\" samples is due to the segregation of iron to the precipitates and surrounding defects.  We express our data in terms of a \"residual\" minority carrier lifetime, τresidual, defined according to:(7)1τresidual=1τmeasured-(1τband-to-band+1τCEAuger+1τFei)where τmeasured is the measured minority carrier lifetime with iron in the interstitial state, τband-to-band is the lifetime due to band-to-band recombination (from [43]), τCE Auger is the lifetime due to Coloumb-enhanced Auger recombination (from [44]) and τFei is the lifetime due to SRH recombination at bulk interstitial iron (parameters from [30]).  Injection-dependent lifetime measurements on a set of p-type iron contaminated samples are plotted in Fig. 6.  It is interesting to note that the recombination activity of oxide precipitates in both \"uncontaminated\" and contaminated samples appears to be approximately dependent upon precipitate density and not size.  The lifetime data for such samples could be fitted with the same recombination parameters extracted from the samples for which the better surface passivation scheme was used.  Do oxide precipitates and associated defects affect recombination in one type more than another?  We have used injection-dependent minority carrier lifetime measurements to study this recombination activity in ∼100 samples with different types, doping levels, precipitate morphologies and sizes.  Can the impact of oxide precipitates on minority carrier lifetime be systematically quantified?\n",
      "Single-crystal Czochralski silicon used for photovoltaics is typically supersaturated with interstitial oxygen at temperatures just below the melting point.  Oxide precipitates therefore can form during ingot cooling and cell processing, and nucleation sites are typically vacancy-rich regions.  Oxygen precipitation gives rise to recombination centres, which can reduce cell efficiencies by as much as 4% (absolute).  We have studied the recombination behaviour in p-type and n-type monocrystalline silicon with a range of doping levels intentionally processed to contain oxide precipitates with a range of densities, sizes and morphologies.  We analyse injection-dependent minority carrier lifetime measurements to give a full parameterisation of the recombination activity in terms of Shockley-Read-Hall statistics.  We intentionally contaminate specimens with iron, and show recombination activity arises from iron segregated to oxide precipitates and surrounding defects.  We find that phosphorus diffusion gettering reduces the recombination activity of the precipitates to some extent.  We also find that bulk iron is preferentially gettered to the phosphorus diffused layer rather than to oxide precipitates.  Oxygen precipitation reduces absolute efficiency of silicon solar cells by up to 4%.  Full parameterisation of minority carrier lifetime due to oxide precipitates.  Iron contamination of oxide precipitates increases recombination activity.  Recombination activity reduced by phosphorus diffusion gettering.  Bulk iron gettered to phosphorus diffused layer, not oxide precipitates.\n",

      "Summary for Minority carrier lifetime in silicon photovoltaics: The effect of oxygen precipitation: Here, the synthesis of high surface area, CdS/mesoporous starch (MS) hybrids are presented, where the unique environment of a starch gel is utilised to confine the growth of the CdS phase.  Images of the presented CdS/MS materials acquired by TEM indicate that at low CdS loadings, the CdS phase is well distributed and dispersed within the porous structure, with individual CdS nanoparticle having ∼4-6nm diameters (Fig. 6(A)).  The complimentary interaction of the porous polysaccharide (starch) gel and the growing CdS inorganic phase and the resulting electrostatic repulsive forces generated materials with very high nanoparticle loadings, surprisingly high surface area, volumes and small CdS species.  By comparison with previous reports and associated diffraction peaks for bulk CdS, and the diffraction patterns of CdS/MS materials presented here (i.e. CdS1 and CdS2), all the characteristic peaks are broadened, in agreement with the nature of the nanocrystalline (i.e. cubic phase) CdS [16].  To characterise the optical absorption properties of the prepared CdS/MS materials, DRUVs spectroscopy was employed (Fig. 5).  CdS/MS materials were prepared at increasing cadmium to starch ratios (w/w) and the bright yellow colouration observed during the addition of the reagents to the starch gel was maintained in the recovered solid with (as expected) a higher loading of CdS indicated by an increasingly stronger yellow appearance (Fig. 1).  The CdS/MS materials, prepared at increasing CdS/starch (w/w) ratios, are synthesised in a straightforward manner based on green chemistry principles [13], demonstrating the straightforward, utile and transferable nature of the presented approach.  Preparation of mesoporous starch (MS)-supported CdS materials (CdS/MS) was conducted adapting a method developed by Hullavarad et al. [14] which conveniently allowed the introduction of the cadmium acetate and sodium sulfide precursors during solvent exchange in the preparation of MS.  It is important to note that the presented results are somewhat unexpected given previous work (e.g. a pore filling model with PdNPs) [11(b)], and highlights the unusual nature of these porous polysaccharide networks - via the introduction of charged species and growth of CdS nanoparticles within the porous structure, the material porosity adapts, presumably as the flexible soft, biopolymer network adapts its porosity to accommodate the growing CdS phase.  Such a reorganisation and restructuring of the polysaccharide phase with increasing CdS loading can potentially be explained by repulsive forces and changes in surface charge as the porous hybrid structure is formed, generating the observed higher total pore volumes and expansion of the corresponding pore size distributions (Fig. 4).  Pure control samples of MS and CdS were also prepared to provide comparison.  35nm is in good agreement with the work of Hillmyer et al. who observed similar blue band edge shifts for CdS nanoparticles prepared using nanoporous polystyrene monoliths as size directing agent, commenting that the blue shift was the result of CdS particle size decrease [20].  Given the N2 sorption isotherm profiles and corresponding pore size distributions, it potentially can be inferred that there exists a degree of complimentary, self-organisation and arrangement between the starch gel and forming phase CdS phase during synthesis resulting firstly in an increase in the overall textural \"quality\" in the final porous products.  Given the density of CdS (ρ=4.83gcm-3) and that loading is based on 1.0g of the MS support, the actual pore volume of starch support for CdS1, can be estimated as >1.5cm3g-1; notably three times higher than the original MS control sample.  With increasing CdS loading, the diffraction patterns become better resolved from the amorphous MS support pattern.\n",
      "The preparation of high surface area, mesoporous cubic CdS/starch hybrids is presented.  A colloidal starch gel confines CdS growth to small, cubic nanoparticles (<40nm).  The method allows very high CdS loadings (i.e. 1:1wt/wt).  The gel and CdS phase interact to maintain surface and porosity of original gel.  The green route is applicable to a range of quantum dots and polysaccharide gels.  A method for preparing CdS nanoparticles within the porous confines of a mesoporous starch gel is described.  This method utilises the combined colloidal and flexible chemical nature of a porous polysaccharide (i.e. starch) gel to limit CdS growth.  The resulting hybrid gels can be dried to produce CdS/starch materials with high surface areas, predominantly mesoporous characteristics and scope for high CdS loading.  The synthesis is conducted in aqueous alcoholic solutions without the need for expensive preparation techniques or additional protection/templating strategies.  Materials were prepared at increasing CdS loadings on the starch gel, which confined nanoparticle growth and directed size/surface coverage, dispersion and UV-vis absorption profile.  The resulting powders presented large mesopore domains with high volumes (pore diameters>10nm; Vmeso>0.5cm3g-1) and surface areas (SBET>170m2g-1), interestingly effectively increasing with CdS loading.  The synthesised CdS nanoparticles were characterised in the 5-40nm range of a cubic crystalline structure, increasing in size with loading.  A complete surface coverage of the starch gel structure occurs at a CdS/starch ratio=1 (w/w), allowing the synthesis of a unique mesoporous CdS/polysaccharide hybrid.  The presented route is simple, green and in principle extendable to a wide range of QDs and polysaccharide gels, whereby the porous polysaccharide gel acts as the deposition point of Cd2+, directing and stabilising both the growth of the inorganic CdS phase and the expanded high surface area polysaccharide form.\n",

      "Summary for Colloidal construction of porous polysaccharide-supported cadmium sulphide: Given a SOIS S=(U,C∪{d},V,f) at time t, the deletion of object x¯∈U (x¯ denotes the deleted object) will change the original information granules [x]AΔ⩾ (x∈U,A⊆C) and the union of decision classes Di⩾ (1⩽i⩽r).  Algorithm 2 is an incremental algorithm for updating approximations in SOIS while deleting an object from the universe.  Algorithm 3 is an incremental algorithm for updating approximations in SOIS while inserting an object into the universe.  Zhang et al. discussed the change of approximations in neighborhood decision systems when the object set evolves over time, and proposed two fast incremental algorithms for updating approximations when multiple objects enter into or get out of the neighborhood decision table [33].  Based on the above analysis, we can compute the approximations of the union of existing decision classes Di⩾ (1⩽i⩽r) when inserting a new object into SOIS.  Algorithm 1 is a static (non-incremental) algorithm for computing the lower and upper approximations in SOIS while the object set in the information system is changed.  Here, we only discuss the incremental approach for updating approximations in the cases that a single object enter and go out of the information system.  To illustrate our incremental methods for updating approximations when inserting a new object into SOIS, two tables (Tables 3 and 4) are given as follows.  Given a SOIS (U,C∪{d},V,f) at time t, when the information system is updated by inserting a new object x̃ (x̃ denotes the inserted object) into the unverse U at time t+1, two situations may occur: (1) x̃ forms a new decision class, i.e., ∀x∈U,f(x̃,d)≠f(x,d); (2) x̃ does not form a new decision class, i.e., ∃x∈U,f(x̃,d)=f(x,d).\n",
      "Incremental learning is an efficient technique for knowledge discovery in a dynamic database, which enables acquiring additional knowledge from new data without forgetting prior knowledge.  Rough set theory has been successfully used in information systems for classification analysis.  Set-valued information systems are generalized models of single-valued information systems, which can be classified into two categories: disjunctive and conjunctive.  Approximations are fundamental concepts of rough set theory, which need to be updated incrementally while the object set varies over time in the set-valued information systems.  In this paper, we analyze the updating mechanisms for computing approximations with the variation of the object set.  Two incremental algorithms for updating the approximations in disjunctive/conjunctive set-valued information systems are proposed, respectively.  Furthermore, extensive experiments are carried out on several data sets to verify the performance of the proposed algorithms.  The results indicate the incremental approaches significantly outperform non-incremental approaches with a dramatic reduction in the computational speed.\n",

      "Summary for Incremental approaches for updating approximations in set-valued ordered information systems: The Friedman test statistic is based on the average ranked (AR) performances of the classification techniques on each data set, and is calculated as follows:(11)χF2=12DK(K+1)∑j=1KARj2-K(K+1)24,whereARj=1D∑i=1Drij.In (13), D denotes the number of data sets used in the study, K is the total number of classifiers and rij is the rank of classifier j on data set i.  For this empirical study our focus is on the performance of classification techniques on data sets with a large class imbalance.  These data sets will then have the size of their minority class of defaulters further reduced by decrements of 5% (from an original 70/30 good/bad split) to see how the performance of the various classification techniques is affected by increasing class imbalance.  A brief explanation will then be given for the ten classification techniques to be used in the analysis of the data sets.  Two techniques that have yet to be fully researched in the context of credit scoring, i.e., gradient boosting and random forests, were also chosen to give a broader review of the techniques available.  Hence, the aim of this paper is to conduct a study of various classification techniques based on five real-life credit scoring data sets.  Furthermore, many empirical studies only evaluate a small number of classification techniques on a single credit scoring data set.  For the purpose of this study, ten classifiers have been selected which provide a balance between well-established credit scoring techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees and neural networks, and newly developed machine learning techniques such as least square support vector machines, gradient boosting and random forests.  The final split, displaying a 99% good, 1% bad class split, indicates that, at the most extreme class distribution analysed, two classification techniques are significantly worse (Lin LS-SVM and QDA).\n",
      "In this paper, we set out to compare several techniques that can be used in the analysis of imbalanced credit scoring data sets.  In a credit scoring context, imbalanced data sets frequently occur as the number of defaulting loans in a portfolio is usually much lower than the number of observations that do not default.  As well as using traditional classification techniques such as logistic regression, neural networks and decision trees, this paper will also explore the suitability of gradient boosting, least square support vector machines and random forests for loan default prediction.  Five real-world credit scoring data sets are used to build classifiers and test their performance.  In our experiments, we progressively increase class imbalance in each of these data sets by randomly under-sampling the minority class of defaulters, so as to identify to what extent the predictive power of the respective techniques is adversely affected.  The performance criterion chosen to measure this effect is the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC); Friedman's statistic and Nemenyi post hoc tests are used to test for significance of AUC differences between techniques.  The results from this empirical study indicate that the random forest and gradient boosting classifiers perform very well in a credit scoring context and are able to cope comparatively well with pronounced class imbalances in these data sets.  We also found that, when faced with a large class imbalance, the C4.5 decision tree algorithm, quadratic discriminant analysis and k-nearest neighbours perform significantly worse than the best performing classifiers.\n",

      "Summary for An experimental comparison of classification algorithms for imbalanced credit scoring data sets: For the control strategy showed in Fig. 3, k1 and ω0 are chosen so that the turbine starts to absorb power at λ=4 for 3 m/s wind speed and maximum CP is still obtained for 6 m/s.  The aim of the control strategy is, for each wind speed, to have a stable equilibrium at a rotational velocity that gives a high power coefficient.  To tune this strategy for the highest power coefficient at a given wind speed, both λmax and CPmax have to be known at this speed.  The investigation here treats control strategies which operate without measurements of the wind speed and where the generator torque is determined from the rotational velocity of the turbine.  This paper investigates control strategies where the extracted power is determined from the rotor speed alone, i.e.  The simulated performance is only slightly lower than for a reference control strategy with known wind speed.  Fig. 1 shows the variation of aerodynamic power, P, with the rotational velocity for a given wind speed.  As the power is proportional to the cube of the wind speed, keeping the correct tip speed ratio at high wind speeds is more important, which is the reason for the improved performance of strategies A-C, compared to the reference control strategy, during very rapid wind oscillations.  Experiences from the test setup in Marsta [25] indicate that the actual power coefficient at low tip speed ratios is higher than the simulated values, which increases the stability of the control strategy and should therefore not be an issue for the chosen control strategy.  If this strategy operates at the stable equilibrium and there is an increase in wind speed, the aerodynamic power will increase, hence P>Pe and the turbine will accelerate until a new equilibrium is reached (compare with Fig. 5).  In the low wind speed case at wind frequencies of 0.01-0.03 Hz, the generator efficiency is higher with the reference strategy than with the other strategies, since strategies A-C operate at too high rotational velocities and thereby increase the already dominant core loss.  Control strategies A-C are implemented by controlling the load current so that the average of the extracted power Pe from the turbine is as close as possible to the power Pe* prescribed by the applied control strategy.  The equilibria in the power plot illustrate the steady state performance while the speed of the control strategy is directly proportional to the difference in torque.\n",
      "A control system for a vertical axis wind turbine is presented.  The electric load is determined solely from the rotational velocity and the characteristics of the turbine, thus measurements of the incoming wind speed are not required.  The control system is evaluated with an aerodynamic vortex model coupled with an electrical model.  Three different sets of control system parameters are tested, representing different tradeoffs between a high power absorption and achieving a fast control strategy with high stability.  The simulations show that the three control strategies provide a similar power absorption as a reference strategy based on known wind speed.  For dynamic simulations with fast changes in wind speed, the fast control strategies are beneficial.  All control strategies are stable throughout the simulations when proper power absorption characteristics of the turbine are used.  It is also shown that if peak power absorption is estimated at a too low tip speed ratio, the control strategies may inadvertently stop the turbine.  A coupled aerodynamic - electric simulation model is presented.  A control strategy for VAWT that does not require wind measurements is evaluated.  Accuracy of control strategy versus convergence speed is analysed.  The sensitivity of the control parameters is investigated.\n",

      "Summary for Robust VAWT control system evaluation by coupled aerodynamic and electrical simulations: At the time when the mutual topology stops extracting power from turbine 4, the rest of the turbines increase their rotational velocities faster, as the increases in delivered power from turbines 1 and 2 no longer are compensated for by a decrease in power from turbine 4, see Eq.  Even though the reduced turbine power absorption for the mutual topology appears significant for both turbines 3 and 4 (see Fig. 6), those two turbines are the ones that deliver the least energy.  Therefore, the topology is not as important if the differences in wind speed are caused by mutual turbine interaction, compared to the independent turbines in Section 6.1.  (3), N is the number of turbines in the farm and ωi is the rotational velocity of turbine i.  The significant change in behaviour for the mutual topology at time 1800 s occurs when the turbine that experiences the lowest wind speed (turbine 4) stops delivering power and all turbine power is used to overcome the generator core loss.  The control system used with the separate topology works well for independent turbines, but it is not optimised for turbine farms.  If the wind speed differences among the turbines are due to the turbines' mutual interaction, the mutual and the separate topologies are almost equal in performance.  For the other two turbines (middle turbines), one is in the wake of the other and it should therefore be a viable strategy to reduce the extraction for the first turbine for a higher power extraction on the second turbine.  In the case with significant differences in wind speed between different turbines, it is investigated if the total power for the mutual topology can be increased through modification of the extracted power according to(14)Pe,k=k∑i=1NPe(ωi).  For the line configuration, where the turbines are nearly independent, this is disadvantageous as it does not allow each turbine to fully adapt to the changes in wind speed.  It was seen in Section 6.1 that for large variations in wind speed between the turbines, the separate topology should perform better, which is seen here.  For the square configuration, a rapid increase in wind speed causes the front turbine to obtain a high rotational velocity, which generates a large wake behind the turbine.  The aim is instead to show that a simple topology, such as the mutual DC-bus, can be a viable solution for the control of a vertical axis turbine farm as it can obtain relatively good performance without the need for wind speed measurements and additional electrical components.\n",
      "A wind farm with a simple electrical topology based on passive rectifiers and a single inverter (mutual topology) is compared to a more complex topology where each turbine has a separate inverter (separate topology).  In both cases, the turbines are controlled electrically by varying the extracted power with the rotational velocity as control signal.  These two electrical topologies are evaluated with respect to the absorbed power for a farm of four turbines placed either on a line or in a square configuration.  The evaluation is done with a vortex model for the aerodynamics, coupled with a model of the electromechanical system.  Simulations predict that individual control is beneficial for aerodynamically independent turbines if the wind speeds differ significantly between the turbines.  If the differences in wind speed are caused by one turbine operating in the wake of another, the deviations in power output between the topologies are less prominent.  The mutual topology can even deliver more power than the separate topology when one turbine is in the wake of another turbine if the wind speed changes rapidly.  A VAWT farm is simulated with vortex model coupled with electric model.  An electric system with passive rectifiers and a mutual DC-bus has been evaluated.  The proposed electric system is viable for a vertical axis wind turbine farm.  The aerodynamic interactions between the turbines is important for the evaluation.  The inter turbine distance is far more important than the electrical topology.\n",

      "Summary for Aerodynamic and electrical evaluation of a VAWT farm control system with passive rectifiers and mutual DC-bus: For the turbine optimisation problem, we wish to maximise a single output (the power extracted) with respect to many input parameters (the positions and tuning parameters of the turbines); this means that the adjoint approach is the natural choice, as the required gradient information can be computed in a number of equation solves that is independent of the number of turbines.  Two optimisation runs were conducted, with 128 and 256 turbines respectively.  For the turbine optimisation problem considered here, the design parameter m is a vector containing the positions, and optionally the tuning parameters, of the turbines.  In all numerical experiments, the optimisation algorithm was initialised with the 32 turbines deployed in a regular 8 × 4 grid and with box constraints for the turbine positions to ensure that the turbines remain inside the site areas.  The optimisation was performed without enforcing a minimum distance between the turbines.  In all examples, 32 turbines are to be deployed in a rectangular turbine site of size 320 m × 160 m.  It fully accounts for the nonlinear interactions between the geometry, the turbines, and the flow throughout the optimisation.  To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first application of the adjoint method to the optimisation of turbine arrays.  Second, the optimisation parameters were extended to include the friction coefficients K of each turbine in the parameterisation (5).  The source-code of the turbine farm optimisation software and all examples are open-source and available at http://opentidalfarm.org.  In this work, the optimal configuration of tidal turbine farms was formulated as an optimisation problem constrained by partial differential equations describing the flow.  The optimisation of tidal turbine farms is necessary to realise their full potential, but without gradient-based optimisation techniques the computational cost is prohibitive [42].  This gradient is used by the optimisation algorithm to automatically reposition the turbines and to adjust their tuning parameters.  Eastern and western 'barrages' of densely packed turbines; in the 128 turbine case, the barrages consist of a single meridional column, while for the 256 turbine case the extra turbines are used to form additional columns.  The use of gradient-based optimisation algorithms combined with the adjoint technique enables the use of physically-realistic flow models, even for a large number of turbines.  Firstly, the layout problem for scenario 1 (Fig. 3a) was solved without enforcing a minimum distance between turbines, i.e. the turbines can be placed arbitrarily inside the site area and may even overlap.  In Section 2, we formulate the turbine configuration problem as an optimisation problem constrained by the shallow water equations.\n",
      "Oceanic tides have the potential to yield a vast amount of renewable energy.  Tidal stream generators are one of the key technologies for extracting and harnessing this potential.  In order to extract an economically useful amount of power, hundreds of tidal turbines must typically be deployed in an array.  This naturally leads to the question of how these turbines should be configured to extract the maximum possible power: the positioning and the individual tuning of the turbines could significantly influence the extracted power, and hence is of major economic interest.  However, manual optimisation is difficult due to legal site constraints, nonlinear interactions of the turbine wakes, and the cubic dependence of the power on the flow speed.  The novel contribution of this paper is the formulation of this problem as an optimisation problem constrained by a physical model, which is then solved using an efficient gradient-based optimisation algorithm.  In each optimisation iteration, a two-dimensional finite element shallow water model predicts the flow and the performance of the current array configuration.  The gradient of the power extracted with respect to the turbine positions and their tuning parameters is then computed in a fraction of the time taken for a flow solution by solving the associated adjoint equations.  These equations propagate causality backwards through the computation, from the power extracted back to the turbine positions and the tuning parameters.  This yields the gradient at a cost almost independent of the number of turbines, which is crucial for any practical application.  The utility of the approach is demonstrated by optimising turbine arrays in four idealised scenarios and a more realistic case with up to 256 turbines in the Inner Sound of the Pentland Firth, Scotland.  The layout optimisation of tidal farms was formulated as a PDE-constrained optimisation problem.  Gradient-based optimisation and the adjoint approach allow the optimisation of many turbines with realistic flow models.  A shallow water model predicts the flow and the farm performance in each optimisation iteration.  The capability of this approach is demonstrated by optimising 256 turbines in a farm in the Inner Sound of the Pentland Firth, Scotland.  The software framework is open-source and available at http://opentidalfarm.org.\n",

      "Summary for Tidal turbine array optimisation using the adjoint approach: The simulations show that a turbine in a channel experiences an increase in power coefficient compared to a turbine in a free flow and that the peak for the power coefficient occurs at a higher tip speed ratio.  In this case, the turbine peaks for a power coefficient of 53.3% for free flow.  The study has later been extended by Vennell [32,33], who combined the reduction in flow velocity with a model of how the turbine's efficiency depends on blockage and demonstrated that the maximum power coefficient of the turbine becomes limited due to the reduction of the flow in the channel.  The more general case with a channel of arbitrary width has been studied by Garrett and Cummings [1], and according to their estimates, the maximum power that can be extracted in a channel is(9)Pmax=CP,max12Aρu03(1-ε)2,where A is the turbine cross-sectional area, u0 is the asymptotic flow velocity, ρ is the density and CP,max is the maximum power coefficient for free flow, i.e.  6 and 9, equation (9) can theoretically be used to estimate the power coefficient for the turbine in free flow if a simulation is performed with channel walls.  The power coefficient of the single turbine reference case in free flow can be found in Fig. 1 for four different turbine solidities(12)σ=NbcR.Here, Nb is the number of blades, c is the chord and R is the radius.  Compared to the idealized theoretical maximum for channels, the simulations show that the increase in performance due to the channel for a turbine optimized for free flow is smaller than the simple analytical expectation, and this difference increases with increased blockage ratio.  In this case, the flow boundaries increase turbine performance [1,2].  As the wake of the heavily loaded turbine decreases the flow velocity at the turbine more and drifts away slower due to this lower flow velocity, more revolutions are required.  The simulations also indicate that the turbine should be designed differently for the channel case.  By looking at the predicted power coefficients of the free flow turbine in Fig. 1, a turbine with σ = 0.12 appears to be a good choice in this case, and the results for this turbine are plotted in Fig. 5 for three different channel widths.  With the same convergence criterion as for the free flow and all turbines simulated at optimal tip speed ratio, the convergence for a turbine with σ = 0.12 is given in Fig. 4.  For the design of the turbine, the simulations with higher solidities show that when designing a turbine for a channel, the optimal design will be different compared to the free flow case.  Additionally, for an open channel flow, there will be an immediate drop in water level over the turbine.\n",
      "The power coefficient of a turbine increases according to the predictions from streamtube theory for sites with a confined fluid flow.  Here, a vertical axis turbine (optimized for free flow) has been simulated by a two-dimensional vortex method, both in a channel and in free flow.  The first part of the study concerns the numerical parameters of channel simulations.  It is found that for free flow and wide channels, a large number of revolutions is required for convergence (around 100 at the optimal tip speed ratio and increasing with higher tip speed ratio), while for smaller channels, the required number of revolutions decreases.  The second part analyses changes in turbine performance by the channel boundaries.  The turbine performance increases when the channel width is decreased, although the results are below the predictions from streamtube theory, and this difference increases with decreasing channel width.  It is also observed that the optimal tip speed ratio increases with decreasing channel width.  By increasing the chord, which decreases the optimal tip speed ratio, the power coefficient can be increased somewhat.  Theory for extending a vortex model to a channel included.  The extracted power for a turbine increases with decreasing channel width.  The optimal tip speed ratio for a turbine increases with decreasing channel width.  Turbines in a channel should have larger blades than in free flow.  Wide channels require many simulated revolution for convergence.\n",

      "Summary for Simulations of a vertical axis turbine in a channel: Based on the simulated wind speeds and the model of turbine installed at each farm, the ideal load factor of UK onshore wind farms should average 38.4%, whereas the mean observed load factor for these farms from 2002 to 12 has been 26.3%.  We therefore use wind speed data with high temporal and spatial resolution, and measure the performance of wind farms by estimating their theoretical potential output over the course of a month and comparing this with the actual reported load factors.  Simulated ideal outputs are compared with actual monthly load factors from a large portion of the UK's fleet over the last decade (282 wind farms, 4.5 GW, 53 TWh), yielding the normalised performance of each wind farm accounting for its wind resource availability, and a set of weather-corrected load factors which reveal the effects of ageing.  This paper uses public domain data to infer the hour-by-hour wind speeds at the site of every wind farm in the UK, and the power curve for each farm's model of turbine to estimate the output that they would ideally produce.  Several factors can confound the relationship between age and observed output in a fleet of wind farms, given that a turbine's output is dependent on wind speeds at its site and the efficiency with which it captures the energy in that wind.  Wake effects: wind farms suffer from power loss as interactions between neighbouring turbines increase turbulence and reduce wind speeds; for relatively small (up to 20 turbine) onshore farms estimates are in the region of 5-15% [25,32-35];  Data from 2005 to 2012 covers 25 TWh of output from the 47 wind farms highlighted in Fig. 6a.  The ideal load factors derived from these wind speeds ignore a number of factors that will reduce the actual output attained by a wind farm at the given location and hub height.  That report suggested that the load factors of wind farms in the UK have declined by 5-13% per year, normalising for month-by-month variations in wind speeds.  This was based on econometric analysis of monthly load factors, using a regression which corrected for the quality of each wind farm's location, the monthly variation in national wind conditions, and the age of each farm.  Four systematic factors determine the actual output of a wind farm: wind speeds at the site, the quality of individual turbine locations (with regards to turbulence and masking), the model of turbine installed and age-related deterioration of performance.  In our model, the systematic effect of location-specific wind speeds and turbine model are both incorporated in the ideal load factor data, while the site dummy variables measure the extent to which each farm's surroundings and layout systematically give it more or less wind than the simulation predicts.  When variations in the weather and improvement in turbine design are accounted for, we find that the load factors of UK wind farms fall by 1.57% (0.41 percentage points) per year.  If performance declines with wind farm age, we would expect the reported load factor to fall relative to the simulated wind speed over the sample period.  The average monthly wind speed at UK onshore wind farms was estimated to be 7.5 ± 1.5 m/s at the location and hub height of each farm, which average 62 m above ground.  Figs. 2 and 3 show what has happened to the load factor of these wind farms as they get older.  The correlation between monthly average speed and reported load factor is also high for individual wind farms (averaging 0.84), as shown in Supplementary Fig. 12.\n",
      "Ageing is a fact of life.  Just as with conventional forms of power generation, the energy produced by a wind farm gradually decreases over its lifetime, perhaps due to falling availability, aerodynamic performance or conversion efficiency.  Understanding these factors is however complicated by the highly variable availability of the wind.  This paper reveals the rate of ageing of a national fleet of wind turbines using free public data for the actual and theoretical ideal load factors from the UK's 282 wind farms.  Actual load factors are recorded monthly for the period of 2002-2012, covering 1686 farm-years of operation.  Ideal load factors are derived from a high resolution wind resource assessment made using NASA data to estimate the hourly wind speed at the location and hub height of each wind farm, accounting for the particular models of turbine installed.  By accounting for individual site conditions we confirm that load factors do decline with age, at a similar rate to other rotating machinery.  Wind turbines are found to lose 1.6 ± 0.2% of their output per year, with average load factors declining from 28.5% when new to 21% at age 19.  This trend is consistent for different generations of turbine design and individual wind farms.  This level of degradation reduces a wind farm's output by 12% over a twenty year lifetime, increasing the levelised cost of electricity by 9%.  Highlights:  The output of 282 wind farms is accurately estimated using public wind speed data.  Correcting for variability in the weather allows wind turbine ageing to be studied.  Onshore wind farm output falls 16% a decade, possibly due to availability and wear.  Performance decline with age is seen in all farms and all generations of turbines.  Decreasing output over a farm's life increases the levelised cost of electricity.\n",

      "Summary for How does wind farm performance decline with age?: Single large-scale deletions of mtDNA were the first mtDNA genetic defects to be described and associated with human mitochondrial disorders [21].  Each mitochondrial nucleoid appears to contain a single mtDNA molecule.  This observation, taken together with ongoing research examining the role the mitochondrial nucleoid plays in mtDNA distribution, is likely to be important in unravelling the cause of extreme tissue segregation seen in mtDNA deletion disorders.  However, one third of patients harbour a common 4977bp mtDNA deletion [44,47,48].  In 1988 Holt et al. identified a deleted mtDNA subpopulation in skeletal muscle but not blood in nine patients with mitochondrial myopathy.  MtDNA is also packaged as protein-DNA complexes called nucleoids, which may be the units of mtDNA transmission and inheritance [12,13].  In PMPS the mtDNA deletions are usually present at higher levels in blood than other tissues, so diagnosis is reliably made using leucocyte mtDNA.  KSS is most commonly associated with single large-scale deletions of mtDNA [56].  Although single mtDNA deletions were the first mtDNA mutations associated with human disease [21], there are still many unanswered questions surrounding their origin and propagation.\n",
      "Over 20years ago single clonal deletions were the first mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genetic defects described in association with human disease.  Since then very large numbers of children and adults harbouring such deletions have been described and it is clear they are an important cause of human mitochondrial disease.  However, there still remain many important challenges in relation to our understanding of mechanisms leading to deletion formation and propagation and in relation to the factors determining the complex and varying relationship between genotype and clinical phenotype.  Although multidisciplinary team care is essential and can improve quality of life and outcomes for patients, a definitive molecular treatment for single mtDNA deletions remains an important translational research goal.  Patients with mtDNA deletions exhibit a very wide range of different clinical phenotypes with marked variation in age at onset and disease severity.  Single mtDNA deletions may enter into the differential diagnosis of many different paediatric and adult presentations across a wide range of medical specialties, although neurological presentations are amongst the most common.  In this review, we examine the molecular mechanisms underpinning mtDNA replication and we consider the hypotheses proposed to explain the formation and propagation of single large-scale mtDNA deletions.  We also describe the range of clinical features associated with single mtDNA deletions, outline a molecular diagnostic approach and discuss current management including the role of aerobic and resistance exercise training programmes.\n",

      "Summary for Single deletions in mitochondrial DNA - Molecular mechanisms and disease phenotypes in clinical practice: For scleractinian corals (i.e. calcareous skeleton forming corals), many studies demonstrate a reduction in growth (net calcification rates) in response to ocean acidification (Gattuso et al., 1998; Kleypas and Langdon, 2006; Krief et al., 2010; Langdon and Atkinson, 2005; Marubini et al., 2003).  To this end, respiration and net calcification rates were calculated in corals exposed to increased CO2 conditions every 7 days for a total period of 21 days.  The respiration rates for coral fragments at Time Zero before fragments were exposed to experimental conditions was 23µmolO2g-1h-1.  Net calcification rates in L. pertusa are often highly variable, even within studies where fragments are collected from the same locale and time of year.  This complements a 24-h study by Maier et al. (2012) and a longer-term experiment by Form and Riebesell (2012), where growth rates of L. pertusa did not significantly change under different CO2 conditions.  For fragments in the control treatment at 380ppm, 9.5°C, pH 8.07 (Table 3), there was no significant change in respiration rates from Time Zero to 21 days.  Net calcification rates as measured by the alkalinity anomaly technique and 14C uptake, did not differ between control and experimental fragments, even though experimental fragments were at a much lower aragonite saturation level (still>1).  Following techniques from Smith and Key (1975), and Ohde and Hossain (2004) calcification rates were calculated in L. pertusa by measuring the change in seawater alkalinity in respiration chambers housing coral fragments for 4h.  The stable net calcification rates reported in this study are in contrast to the reduced respiration in experimental fragments.  The sustained net calcification rates of L. pertusa under elevated CO2 conditions corresponds with other studies, but the observed decrease in respiration rate highlights an energetic imbalance, whereby L. pertusa may be forced to use energetic reserves to maintain calcification rates.\n",
      "Cold-water corals are associated with high local biodiversity, but despite their importance as ecosystem engineers, little is known about how these organisms will respond to projected ocean acidification.  Since preindustrial times, average ocean pH has decreased from 8.2 to ~8.1, and predicted CO2 emissions will decrease by up to another 0.3 pH units by the end of the century.  This decrease in pH may have a wide range of impacts upon marine life, and in particular upon calcifiers such as cold-water corals.  Lophelia pertusa is the most widespread cold-water coral (CWC) species, frequently found in the North Atlantic.  Here, we present the first short-term (21 days) data on the effects of increased CO2 (750ppm) upon the metabolism of freshly collected L. pertusa from Mingulay Reef Complex, Scotland, for comparison with net calcification.  Over 21 days, corals exposed to increased CO2 conditions had significantly lower respiration rates (11.4±1.39 SE, µmolO2g-1tissuedryweighth-1) than corals in control conditions (28.6±7.30 SE µmolO2g-1tissuedryweighth-1).  There was no corresponding change in calcification rates between treatments, measured using the alkalinity anomaly technique and 14C uptake.  The decrease in respiration rate and maintenance of calcification rate indicates an energetic imbalance, likely facilitated by utilisation of lipid reserves.  These data from freshly collected L. pertusa from the Mingulay Reef Complex will help define the impact of ocean acidification upon the growth, physiology and structural integrity of this key reef framework forming species.\n",

      "Summary for Short-term metabolic and growth responses of the cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa to ocean acidification: In this paper, we write the QoS parameter of a path and the constraints of a request as (cost,delay).  In two-dimensional scaling, the cost metric and delay metric are quantized by the same method.  If we use the logarithmic scaling method on cost, we get the approximated function in Fig. 5(a).  If we use uniform scaling, by setting δt=2δs, we can consider that the total number of quantized cost and delay values for two-dimensional scaling is the same as that for cost-scaling.  On the other hand, the total number of the cost and delay values taken by two-dimensional scaling reduces with the same rate as that of cost-scaling.  For example, in Fig. 2(b), the QoS parameter of the minimum cost path is (4,7), and the QoS parameter of the minimum delay path is (8,4).  We can see that the total distortion area of two-dimensional scaling depends on the number of the optimal representative points n.  In the existing approximation algorithms, the cost metric is quantized, so that we can get the approximate delay function D(c).  In this work, we consider connection requests that have two additive QoS requirements or constraints, such as in delay and cost.  If we use logarithmic scaling, by setting δt=2δs, the total number of possible cost values and delay values by two-dimensional scaling is 2log1+2δsUB, and the number of cost values by cost-scaling is log1+δsUB.  Thus, Cmax denotes the maximum cost deviation at any cost value as well as the maximum delay deviation at any delay value produced by two-dimensional scaling.\n",
      "Precomputation of the supported QoS is very important for internet routing.  By constructing routing tables before a request arrives, a packet can be forwarded with a simple table lookup.  When the QoS information is provided, a node can immediately know whether a certain request can be supported without launching the path finding process.  Unfortunately, as the problem of finding a route satisfying two additive constraints is NP-complete, the supported QoS information can only be approximated using a polynomial time mechanism.  A good approximation scheme should reduce the error in estimating the actual supported QoS.  Nevertheless, existing approaches which determine this error may not truly reflect the performance on admission control, meaning whether a request can be correctly classified as feasible or infeasible.  In this paper, we propose using a novel metric, known as distortion area, to evaluate the performance of precomputing the supported QoS.  We then analyze the performance of the class of algorithms that approximate the supported QoS through discretizing link metrics.  We demonstrate how the performance of these schemes can be enhanced without increasing complexity.  Our results serve as a guideline on developing discretization-based approximation algorithms.\n",

      "Summary for Performance analysis of quantization-based approximation algorithms for precomputing the supported QoS: Fertilizer doses have to be based on attainable yield and soil nutrient levels.  With regards to the comparison of P input (Fig. 6) and soil P level (Fig. 1) our results confirm the scientific evidence that high P fertilizer inputs with positive P balance will increase the concentrations in the soil (Cordell et al., 2009), and also provide an insight to the regional distribution of different P supply levels in the regions of the EU in relation to P input.  Threshold values of the two fertilizer recommendation systems (Hungary, UK) were used separately to establish plant available P categories for each soil samples from the LUCAS Topsoil Survey.  Unlike for P supply categories the estimation of input need of different regions of the EU results quite different patterns when based on the recommendation systems from Hungary (Antal et al., 1979) and the UK (DEFRA, 2010).  However, considering the fact that the advisory system of the UK would discourage fertilizer use in some of the most fertile regions of the EU and recommends low input to the rest of the EU as well (Fig. 4a) we might well think that fertilizer statistics do not catch the exact figures of fertilizer consumption in the EU.  In this study we classified the P concentration of soil samples from the LUCAS topsoil survey based on measured Olsen-P levels using equal-sized data subsets by each 20 percentiles (i) and threshold values of two different fertilizer recommendation systems (ii and iii).  Knowing the different regional distribution of P supply levels in the European Union cannot only be of valuable input in assessing current soil nutrient supply in relation to food security (Lal, 2013) and in assessing the need for fertilizer input to soils in Europe (Schröder et al., 2011) but also be of great value for the study of soil P loss to the environment (Sharpley et al., 2002; Heathwaite et al., 2005).  However, the correlation between yields and P levels in the NUTS2 regions of the EU (Pearson coefficient=0.4; both based on the UK and Hungarian systems) suggest strong, but not exclusive P dependency of yield.  In the meanwhile the Hungarian P fertilizer input was only about 10% of the optimal calculated by the local system on the basis of soil P levels.  P fertilizer requirement of croplands in the EU were calculated by the fertilizer recommendation systems of Hungary (Antal et al., 1979) and UK (DEFRA, 2012b).  Both the UK and the Hungarian systems define five categories with regards to available P levels.  The maps displaying soil P supply based on quintiles (Fig. 1b) show that there are zones with high and low soil P levels which can be delineated in the EU and these zones are following climatic patterns.  According to the Hungarian system there is a need for fertilizer P input in all regions but two (one in Finland and Sardinia) of the EU (Fig. 4b).  The UK system sets fertilizer dose targets according to three yield levels, therefore an interpolation using the forecast function based on regional yield statistics and fertilizer need was applied.  Measured P levels displayed by means of quintile categories of individual cropland topsoil samples in each NUTS region as well as P supply levels established on the basis of the systems of the UK (DEFRA, 2010) and Hungary (Antal et al., 1979) show similar pattern throughout Europe (Figs.  The variability of P levels within the NUTS regions was also analysed by additional descriptive statistics, which show skewed distribution of P levels in soil samples in individual NUTS regions in nearly all cases.  Nevertheless, the first ever uniform topsoil P survey of the EU highlights the contradictions between soil P management of different countries of the Union while also highlights the inconsistencies between reported P fertilizer consumption and advised P doses.  Second, plant available P levels were calculated for all LUCAS topsoil samples taken from agricultural land using the two different fertilizer recommendation methods: one from Hungary and one from the UK.\n",
      "Soil P supply and fertilizer need maps of the EU were elaborated for the first time.  Estimated annual P input need of the EU's agriculture is 3.85 million tons.  Plant available P in cropland soils follows climatic patterns and yield levels in the EU.  Regional P means vary largely but cases with high P levels are present in all regions.  Inconsistencies between advised and reported P fertilizer consumptions pointed out.  In the frame of the Land Use/Land Cover Area Frame Survey sampling of topsoil was carried out on around 22,000 points in 25 EU Member States in 2009 and in additional 2 Member States in 2012.  Besides other basic soil properties soil phosphorus (P) content of the samples were also measured in a single laboratory in both years.  Based on the results of the LUCAS topsoil survey we performed an assessment of plant available P status of European croplands.  Higher P levels can be observed in regions where higher crop yields can be expected and where high fertilizer P inputs are reported.  Plant available phosphorus levels were determined using two selected fertilizer recommendation systems: one from Hungary and one from the United Kingdom.  The fertilizer recommendation system of the UK does not recommend additional fertilizer use on croplands with highest P supply, which covers regions mostly in Belgium and the Netherlands.  According to a Hungarian advisory system there is a need for fertilizer P input in all regions of the EU.  We established a P fertilizer need map based on integrating results from the two systems.  Based on data from 2009 and 2012, P input demand of croplands in the European Union was estimated to 3,849,873 tons(P2O5)/year.  Meanwhile we found disparities of calculated input need and reported fertilizer statistics both on local (country) scale and EU level.  The first ever uniform topsoil P survey of the EU highlights the contradictions between soil P management of different countries of the Union and the inconsistencies between reported P fertilizer consumption and advised P doses.  Our analysis shows a status of a baseline period of the years 2009 and 2012, while a repeated LUCAS topsoil survey can be a useful tool to monitor future changes of nutrient levels, including P in soils of the EU.\n",

      "Summary for Phosphorus levels in croplands of the European Union with implications for P fertilizer use: This value of γ is typical of relaxed grain boundaries in Cu (see Ref.  In the case of Ni with elongated crystallites (item ii), nearly identical values of eGB=0.35×10-10 and 0.32×10-10m were found for the dilatometric measuring directions perpendicular to and parallel to the crystallite elongation, respectively, which confirms the attribution of the length change in stage B to grain boundaries [9].  Since, during annealing in stage A, the crystallite size and, therefore, the fraction of grain boundaries remain nearly constant, the length contraction in this stage has to be attributed to the annealing out of crystal lattice defects as well as to a relaxation of grain boundaries (see Section 4).  Assuming isotropic annealing, the dilatometric length change in stage C minus the contribution from removal of grain boundaries corresponds to a change volume ΔV/V0=3×Δℓ/ℓ0 in the range of 1×10-3, which is smaller than that from the radiotracer experiments by a factor of 2-3.  Attributing this enthalpy release exclusively to the removal of grain boundaries in stage B, a specific grain boundary energy(2)γ=Hρ3dini-1-dfin-1=0.85±0.08Jm-2is estimated using the initial and final crystallite diameters of stage B, as given above (dini=222nm, dfin=764nm), as well as the Cu bulk value of 8.92gcm-3 for the mass density ρ.  A complex defect annealing kinetics is suggested from volume and grain boundary diffusion studies in SPD-processed Cu and Ni [7,8].  In particular, a well-defined narrow stage B also occurs in HPT-Ni due the removal of grain boundaries in the wake of pronounced crystallite growth in this stage [9], similar to Cu.\n",
      "The release of excess volume upon recrystallization of ultrafine-grained Cu deformed by high-pressure torsion (HPT) was studied by means of the direct technique of high-precision difference dilatometry in combination with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and scanning electron microscopy.  From the length change associated with the removal of grain boundaries in the wake of crystallite growth, a structural key quantity of grain boundaries, the grain boundary excess volume or expansion eGB=(0.46±0.11)×10-10 m was directly determined.  The value is quite similar to that measured by dilatometry for grain boundaries in HPT-deformed Ni.  Activation energies for crystallite growth of 0.99±0.11 and 0.96±0.06eV are derived by Kissinger analysis from dilatometry and DSC data, respectively.  In contrast to Ni, substantial length change proceeds in Cu at elevated temperatures beyond the regime of dominant crystallite growth.  In the light of recent findings from tracer diffusion and permeation experiments, this is associated with the shrinkage of nanovoids at high temperatures.\n",

      "Summary for Grain boundary excess volume and defect annealing of copper after high-pressure torsion: Fig. 7 shows the correspondence between the dispersion type and combinations of the Area Disorder and area fraction, for poly-dispersed particles (Fig. 7a) and low-to-moderate aspect ratio elliptical particles (Fig. 7b).  Broadening the distribution of particle sizes, such that the variance in particle areas increases, makes discrete particles appear more clustered than a system of identically sized particles but more regular than if they were either point-like or line-like (depending on aspect ratio).  To investigate the role that the individual particle morphology (size, shape) has on dispersion we model randomly disordered materials containing: (1) non-identical hard-core particles, with a size distribution and (2) non-circular ellipsoid particles with associated orientations and aspect ratios.  The quality of discrete particle (nanoparticle) dispersion, which characterises the uniformity in spread of the particles through the material (i.e. whether the particles are ordered, random or clustered) can affect the material properties [1].  As the variance in particle sizes increases then ADDel rises and the particles appear to be more clustered.\n",
      "Particle-reinforced composites and nanocomposites can contain a wide range of discrete particles, of various morphologies (e.g. spherical, fibre, and tube).  Two-dimensional micrographs of the material are used to assess whether the particles are well- or poorly-dispersed, but typically use the assumption that all particles are identical and spherical.  However we show, by considering elliptical particles, that the sizing and shapes of the discrete particles can change the overall appearance of the system, without the underlying mechanisms changing.  Thus our interpretation of particle dispersion is obtained by comparing our measurements to a reference system, which takes into account the particle morphologies, and demonstrates that discrepancies are brought on by oversimplification.\n",

      "Summary for The effects of particle morphology on the analysis of discrete particle dispersion using Delaunay tessellation: Some samples containing Ti/Al ratios were collected from shore and marine sediments in the marginal seas off China (Fig. 2).  The results of Ti/Al molar ratios show that most of the lake sediments (Fig. 2) have lower Ti/Al ratios than the surface sediments of dry land (100Ti/Al=3.06-3.77) (Fig. 1).  The Ti/Al molar ratios of land soils and outcrops tend to be higher than those on fluvial, estuary, lake and marine sediments.  Recalculating data on the aerosol particles, collected in the East China Sea and Taiwan (Table 3), gives results consistent with a decrease in Ti/Al molar ratios during Asian Dust Storm episodes (Hsu et al., 2004, 2010).  This study involves the spatial distribution of Ti/Al molar ratios in terrestrial and marine sediments in China and Taiwan.  Most of the fluvial sediments show slightly lower Ti/Al molar ratios than those of surface soils (Fig. 3a and b).  In Table 1, molar ratios in sediments Ti/Al are expressed as 100Ti/Al.  The Ti/Al molar ratios in the Kaoping River drainage range from 2.50 to 3.89 in fluvial sediments and 2.73 to 3.94 in surface soils.  To compare our data (Table 1) with those cited from other work (Table 2), 100 times Ti/Al molar ratios (100Ti/Al) are used in this study.  Data show that most 100Ti/Al molar ratios fall between 3 and 4, except those at Sites 8 and 18.  Data on fluvial sediments from the Huanghe and Changjiang Rivers are from previous studies (Yang et al., 2002; Fan et al., 2001).  Comparing data from surface sediments and fluvial sediments (Fig. 1) with those from lake cores and marine sediments (Fig. 2) shows that sink areas are marked by lower Ti/Al molar ratios.  Most 100Ti/Al molar ratios fall in the range 3.06 and 3.77 in northern China and 2.43-2.80 in lake sediments.  Deeper marine sediments appear to have lower Ti/Al molar ratios than shallower ones in SCS (Fig. 2).  This result implies that the Ti/Al molar ratio of fluvial sediments is controlled by parent soils.  Enhanced concentrations of terrigenous elements such as: Al, Si, Fe, K, and Ti have been interpreted as representing increased supply of siliciclastic materials of fluvial or aeolian origin in marine or lacustrine sediments (Goldberg and Arrhenius, 1958; Arz et al., 1998; Jansen et al., 1998; Chen et al., 2010, 2011).  Our results for Ti/Al molar ratios from aeolian source are different to other research.\n",
      "Ti/Al molar ratios of sediments declines during transportation.  Lake and pelagic sediments show relative low Ti/Al ratios.  The declined Ti/Al ratio in aerosol particles indicates Asian dust storm episode.  Ti/Al molar ratios of a deep marine core can estimate sea level changes.  Ti/Al molar ratios of sediments in various sedimentary environments are used to explain sediment transportation from source regions to sink areas.  Samples were collected from outcrops, soils, fluvial, lake, and marine sediment environments.  Initial Ti/Al molar ratios of sediments are controlled by those of parent soils or rocks.  These ratios tend to decline gradually as a result of heavy-mineral gravity fractionation during transportation.  Sedimentary Ti/Al molar ratios in sink areas such as lakes and pelagic environments are lower than those in source regions.  In this study, for the Changjiang River, Huanghe River, and Kaoping River, Ti/Al molar ratios decline considerably from downstream to estuary environments.  Additionally, well sorted aeolian sands have extremely low Ti/Al molar ratios in northern China.  The Ti/Al molar ratios of aerosol particles found in Taiwan and the East China Sea show reduced ratios as a result of Asia Dust Storm episodes.  Furthermore, lower Ti/Al molar ratios in deep ocean sediments were discovered by tracing the distribution of sedimentary Ti/Al molar ratios in the South China Sea.  When sea levels dropped during glacial periods, the river estuary was closer to deep marine areas and carried more terrestrial sediments into deep marine environments.  The closer estuary with relatively higher Ti/Al ratio would lead increase of Ti/Al molar ratios in deep sea sediments.  In this study, Ti/Al molar ratio is promoted as a new proxy to help with understanding changes in sedimentary environments.\n",

      "Summary for The Ti/Al molar ratio as a new proxy for tracing sediment transportation processes and its application in aeolian events and sea level change in East Asia: Reaction of the Schiff base ligand HLa-Maf with ruthenium(III), oxovanadium(IV) and dioxouranium(VI) ions in molar 1:1 and 2:1 afforded the corresponding stoichiometry transition metal complexes.  The vibration frequencies and their tentative assignments for HLa-Maf and H2Lb-Daf ligands and their transition metal complexes are listed in Table 2.  The electronic spectra of the ligands and their transition metal complexes in the solid state with their assignments, magnetic moment and molar conductivity measurement are given in Table 3.  Electronic spectra of DMF solutions of the metal complexes were carried out by using UV-Vis Perkin-Elmer Model Lamda 900.  1 and 2, depicts the proposed structures of the metal complexes.  The vibrational frequencies and tentative assignments for free HLa-Maf and H2Lb-Daf ligands and their transition metal complexes were recorded and are given in Table 2.  The result revealed also that the binuclear complexes enhances the antimicrobial activity rather than the mononuclear complexes [69,70].  Comparing the IR spectra of the complexes with the spectra of the free ligands elucidated the mode of binding of the Schiff bases to the metal ions.  It is possible to draw up the tentative structures of the transition metal complexes.  The reaction of Schiff bases ligands with ruthenium(III), oxovanadium(IV) and dioxouranium(VI), affords a mono or binuclear complex of a cyclic or macrocyclic complexes, according to the mole ratio of metal to ligand.  This is further supported by the band around 752-746cm-1 in the metal complexes due to ν(CS) and is inconsistent with the appearance of new weakly to medium bands in the region 356-382cm-1, which could be assigned to the stretching frequencies of ν(MS) bands, respectively, confirmed that, the chelation to the metal ions is achieved thiol-sulphur atoms [41].

The physical and analytical data of the Schiff base ligands and their corresponding transition metal complexes are listed in Table 1.  There are four main features in the infrared spectra of the complexes.  The electronic spectra of Ru(III) complexes 1, 4, 7 and 10 exhibit mainly three bands at the ranges, (352-432nm), (571-563nm) and (643-663nm), respectively.\n",
      "Thio Schiff base complexes derived from mono- and diacetyl ferrocene were synthesized.  The complexes are characterized by different spectroscopic techniques.  The complexes have different varieties of geometrical structures.  Biochemical studies were studied.  Two series of mono- and binuclear complexes cyclic or acyclic thio-ferocine Schiff base ligands, derived from the condensation of 2-aminobenzenthiol (L) with monoacetyl ferrocene in the molar ratio 1:1 or in the molar ratio 1:2 for diacetyl ferocine have been prepared.  The condensation reactions yield the corresponding Schiff Base ligands, HLa-Maf and H2Lb-Daf.  The chelation of the ligands to metal ions occurs through the sulfur of the thiol group as well as the nitrogen atoms of the azomethine group of the ligands.  HLa-Maf acts as monobasic bidentate or dibasic tetradentate, while H2Lb-Daf behaves as twice negatively cargend tetradentate ligand.  The structures of these ligands were elucidated by elemental analysis, infrared, ultraviolet-visible spectra, as well as 1H NMR spectra.  Reactions of the Schiff bases ligands with ruthenium(III), oxovanadium(IV) and dioxouranium(VI) afforded the corresponding transition metal complexes.  The properties of the newly prepared complexes were analyse by elemental analyses, infrared, electronic spectra, 1H NMR as well as the magnetic susceptibility and conductivity measurement.  The metal complexes exhibits different geometrical arrangements such as octahedral and square pyramidal coordination.  Schiff base ligands and their metal complexes were tested against two pathogenic bacteria as Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as one kind of fungi to study their biological activity.  All the complexes exhibit antibacterial and antifungal activities against these organisms.\n",

      "Summary for Synthesis, spectroscopic, coordination and biological activities of some organometallic complexes derived from thio-Schiff base ligands: We demonstrate that the iron migration in O3-NaFeO2 is effectively suppressed by metal substitution for iron, therefore, sodium insertion/extraction reversibility and capacity of O3-type NaFe0.5Co0.5O2 are surprisingly higher than those of NaCoO2 and NaFeO2 with enhanced capacity retention and rate capability.  Available energy density is estimated to be 510mWhg-1 based on metallic sodium as positive electrode materials for rechargeable Na batteries.  When cut-off voltage is limited to 3.5V, NaFeO2 electrode shows approximately 100mAhg-1 of reversible capacity with nearly 3.3V flat voltage profile.  The loss of reversible capacity is expected to be the degradation of electrolyte solution, especially in relation to the non-passivated surface of metallic sodium as a counter electrode [1].  When the cut-off voltage is limited to 3.4V in the sodium cells, NaFeO2 shows relatively good capacity retention with 80mAhg-1 of reversible capacity.  The most important finding of our article is that large reversible capacity and excellent rate-capability, which are clearly better than those of NaCoO2, are achieved on the basis of NaFeO2-derived sodium insertion materials.  Recently, we revisited the layered NaFeO2 system and a systematic study was conducted to examine the electrode performance by changing the cut-off voltage in Na cells [7].  Ex-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) study revealed an irreversible structure transition, presumably associated with partial migration of iron into adjacent and vacant tetrahedral sites created in Na layer by Na extraction, and thus the loss of Na conduction path.  NaFe0.5Co0.5O2 shows excellent rate-capability with small polarization; more than 75% of discharge capacity even at 10C rate.  In NaFe1-yCoyO2 system, large initial capacity of approximately 160mAhg-1 is observed for NaFe0.4Co0.6O2 and NaFe0.6Co0.4O2 similar to NaFe0.5Co0.5O2.\n",
      "O3-type NaFeO2 is a promising candidate as positive electrode materials for rechargeable Na batteries.  However, its reversible range of sodium extraction is relatively narrow (x=ca.  0.4 in Na1-xFeO2) because of the irreversible structural change, presumably associated with the iron migration into the adjacent tetrahedral sites in Na layers as we recently reported.  Herein, we report that cobalt-substituted NaFeO2 demonstrates excellent electrode performance in a non-aqueous Na cell at room temperature.  NaFe0.5Co0.5O2 delivers approximately 160mAhg-1 of reversible capacity with relatively good capacity retention and excellent rate-capability in a voltage range of 2.5-4.0V, resulting in reversible formation of Na0.3Fe0.5Co0.5O2.  The partial substitution of metal element for Fe in O3-type NaFeO2-based materials is proved to be the important strategy to suppress the irreversible phase transition, and thus improving the reversibility of sodium removal/insertion as the electrode materials.  Synthesis and characterizations of layered NaFe0.5Co0.5O2.  Its electrode performance in Na cell was compared with those of NaFeO2 and NaCoO2.  NaxFe0.5Co0.5O2 is one of the highest power positive electrodes among layered oxides.\n",

      "Summary for Chirality delivery through multiple and helical H-bonding from chiral coordination complex to its supramolecular architecture: In this subsection, we conduct experiments to compare the effectiveness of our proposed CPR-based approach and the CAS approach [18] on detecting LDDoS attack flows under different categories of LDDoS attacks.  In this section, we first propose the metric of CPR and then describe our CPR-based approach to detect and filter LDDoS attack flows.  The Congestion Participation Rate (CPR)-based approach proposed in this paper can detect single LDDoS attack flows.  Compared to existing approaches on detecting LDDoS attacks [9,18,23-27], our CPR-based approach is capable of detecting whether a flow is an attack flow or a normal TCP flow.  This approach is expected to be deployed on a router where we want to detect and filter LDDoS attack flows.  The third category describes the LDDoS attacks in which n flows start at the same time, and the burst rate of the aggregate attack flow is intensified n times.  This is problematic for the CPR-based approach to distinguish LDDoS flows.  Table 3 shows that under DropTail, the CPR-based approach may not be able to distinguish an LDDoS attack flow from a normal TCP flow since the two CPRs are close to one another.  This approach considers both the attack flows' characteristics and their influence on network traffic.  However, since this DTW-based approach used the similarity between real-time LDoS flows and the sampled LDoS flows, it is only effective for the aggregate flow of LDDoS attacks.  In the extreme scenario, the LDDoS attack can throttle all normal TCP flows and the aggregate rate of the LDDoS flows is also very close to the bottleneck bandwidth of network.\n",
      "The recently proposed TCP-targeted Low-rate Distributed Denial-of-Service (LDDoS) attacks send fewer packets to attack legitimate flows by exploiting the vulnerability in TCP's congestion control mechanism.  They are difficult to detect while causing severe damage to TCP-based applications.  Existing approaches can only detect the presence of an LDDoS attack, but fail to identify LDDoS flows.  In this paper, we propose a novel metric - Congestion Participation Rate (CPR) - and a CPR-based approach to detect and filter LDDoS attacks by their intention to congest the network.  The major innovation of the CPR-base approach is its ability to identify LDDoS flows.  A flow with a CPR higher than a predefined threshold is classified as an LDDoS flow, and consequently all of its packets will be dropped.  We analyze the effectiveness of CPR theoretically by quantifying the average CPR difference between normal TCP flows and LDDoS flows and showing that CPR can differentiate them.  We conduct ns-2 simulations, test-bed experiments, and Internet traffic trace analysis to validate our analytical results and evaluate the performance of the proposed approach.  Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CPR-based approach is substantially more effective compared to an existing Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)-based approach - one of the most efficient approaches in detecting LDDoS attacks.  We also provide experimental guidance to choose the CPR threshold in practice.\n",

      "Summary for NaFe0.5Co0.5O2 as high energy and power positive electrode for Na-ion batteries: In mice, hypomorphic mutations are associated with diabetes without evidence of exocrine deficiency (Oliver-Krasinski et al., 2009); we and others have shown that patients with less-severe homozygous missense mutations have neonatal diabetes with normal or mildly impaired exocrine function (De Franco et al., 2013; Nicolino et al., 2010).  The pancreatic phenotype is similar to the three previously reported patients with nonsense or frameshift mutations and the Ptf1a null mouse (Al-Shammari et al., 2011; Krapp et al., 1998; Sellick et al., 2004).  For patients with homozygous mutations, their phenotype (both pancreatic and extrapancreatic) was compared with the phenotype of the knockout mouse for the same gene.  The finding that mutations in NKX2-2 and MNX1 can cause neonatal diabetes takes the number of genes in which mutations are known to cause PNDM from 18 to 20, of which 10 encode pancreatic transcription factors.  Finding inactivating mutations in patients with diabetes can establish the role of a gene in human pancreatic development and function.  For example, biallelic GCK mutations in humans cause permanent neonatal diabetes (PNDM), and mice lacking both copies of the gene have severe hyperglycemia at birth (Njølstad et al., 2001; Terauchi et al., 1995).  Mutations causing a pancreatic/diabetes phenotype have not been found in man for many pancreatic transcription factors important for rodent pancreatic development, but there have been no large, systematic studies of these genes in appropriate patients to date.  For some transcription factor genes the genetic etiology in the patients was initially recognized from the similarity to the mouse phenotype (Rubio-Cabezas et al., 2010; Stoffers et al., 1997).\n",
      "Understanding transcriptional regulation of pancreatic development is required to advance current efforts in developing beta cell replacement therapies for patients with diabetes.  Current knowledge of key transcriptional regulators has predominantly come from mouse studies, with rare, naturally occurring mutations establishing their relevance in man.  This study used a combination of homozygosity analysis and Sanger sequencing in 37 consanguineous patients with permanent neonatal diabetes to search for homozygous mutations in 29 transcription factor genes important for murine pancreatic development.  We identified homozygous mutations in 7 different genes in 11 unrelated patients and show that NKX2-2 and MNX1 are etiological genes for neonatal diabetes, thus confirming their key role in development of the human pancreas.  The similar phenotype of the patients with recessive mutations and mice with inactivation of a transcription factor gene support there being common steps critical for pancreatic development and validate the use of rodent models for beta cell development.  Analyzing a large collection of consanguineous patients with permanent neonatal diabetes, Flanagan et al. performed a comprehensive search for recessive mutations in transcription factors known to be critical for mouse pancreatic development.  They identify seven pancreatic transcription factors that cause neonatal diabetes, including NKX2-2 and MNX1.\n",

      "Summary for Flow level detection and filtering of low-rate DDoS: Between the three connectivity data traces, CafRep achieves lowest success ratio in the SF Cab traces [45] (48-44%) due to three reasons: first due to the SF Cab [45] topology described in Section 5.1, the social utility in CafRep cannot identify nodes that are significantly more central; second as the isolation periods are very high, the nodes cannot offload their content for a very long time; and third as the connectivity periods are very short, the publishing nodes that generate data at a constant rate cause increased dropped packets.  As discussed in Section 3, we believe that this higher cost for CafRep in SF Cab trace [45] comes from high weighting of ego network resources and social utility in a trace that does not have node connectivity with good pattern of regularity.  As these nodes become overloaded, forwarding to a lower ranked node may lead to more even spread of the network load in the network and lower congestion rates, but also to increased number of intermediaries for the forwarded messages.  We proposed CafRep that uses a combined local social, buffer and delay metrics for congestion aware message forwarding and replication that maximises message delivery ratio and availability of nodes while minimising latency and packet loss rates at times of increasing congestion levels.  We believe that higher replication rates for CafRep in SF Cab trace [45] are due to CafRep discovering more forwarding opportunities that the other two adaptive replication protocols do not discover.  When congestion happens, the combined utility allows CafRep to de-cluster individual nodes and parts of the network by leveraging social metric with resource constraints.  Sassy [44] trace is more challenging than Infocom 2006 because it does not include any infrastructure-like nodes (such as semi-static and static nodes such as those deployed during Infocom2006 [33]) that participate in forwarding, has significantly shorter connectivity durations and sparser network.  As described in Fig. 3, when two nodes meet, the sending node scans for neighbouring nodes' and calculates their respective relative CafRep Utilities.  All protocols manage highest availability over the Infocom 2006 trace [33] because this trace is highly social (allows repeating patterns of connectivity) that allows for accurate social/connectivity predictions that CafRep, EBR [26], RR [38] and SnF [37] use.\n",
      "Detecting and dealing with congestion in delay-tolerant networks (DTNs) is an important and challenging problem.  Current DTN forwarding algorithms typically direct traffic towards more central nodes in order to maximise delivery ratios and minimise delays, but as traffic demands increase these nodes may become saturated and unusable.  We propose CafRep, an adaptive congestion aware protocol that detects and reacts to congested nodes and congested parts of the network by using implicit hybrid contact and resources congestion heuristics.  CafRep exploits localised relative utility based approach to offload the traffic from more to less congested parts of the network, and to replicate at adaptively lower rate in different parts of the network with non-uniform congestion levels.  We extensively evaluate our work against benchmark and competitive protocols across a range of metrics over three real connectivity and GPS traces such as Sassy [44], San Francisco Cabs [45] and Infocom 2006 [33].  We show that CafRep performs well, independent of network connectivity and mobility patterns, and consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art DTN forwarding algorithms in the face of increasing rates of congestion.  CafRep maintains higher availability and success ratios while keeping low delays, packet loss rates and delivery cost.  We test CafRep in the presence of two application scenarios, with fixed rate traffic and with real world Facebook application traffic demands, showing that regardless of the type of traffic CafRep aims to deliver, it reduces congestion and improves forwarding performance.\n",

      "Summary for Analysis of Transcription Factors Key for Mouse Pancreatic Development Establishes NKX2-2 and MNX1 Mutations as Causes of Neonatal Diabetes in Man: There was no significant change in the values of the reservoir temperature at the observation well Ktzi202/2007 (Fig. 2) (Möller et al., 2012).  In the Ivanova et al. (2012) study the impact of reservoir temperature on the mass estimation was not included.  In order to investigate the impact of temperature in the reservoir on the 4D seismic data at the Ketzin site, the CO2 saturation and CO2 density, as well as the thickness of the CO2 layer obtained by multiphase fluid flow simulations were used as input to seismic modeling (see Section 2 of this paper).  Fig. 3 illustrates the dependence of CO2 density on pressure and temperature in the reservoir at Ketzin.  To demonstrate this we calculated the difference in Vp between both temperature scenarios present at the Ketzin site at the time of the 1st 3D seismic repeat campaign (Ivanova et al., 2012) using Gassmann's equations (1951) for 50% CO2 saturation.  However, the volumetric estimation of the CO2 based on the 4D seismic data from Ketzin using results from the multiphase fluid flow simulations (Fig. 9) shows that the impact of temperature in the reservoir at the monitoring time is significant for these estimations.  Both pressure and temperature increased due to the injection (Giese et al., 2009; Würdemann et al., 2010).  Porosity was assumed to be constant in the reservoir (20%) for modeling the temperature effects on the seismic data.  Successful integration of reservoir simulations and 4D seismic data analysis at the Sleipner CO2 storage site (e.g. Arts et al., 2004; Chadwick et al., 2010) motivated us to integrate both methods also at the Ketzin site.  Therefore, the modeled time-lapse seismic differences for the two temperature scenarios is minor regarding the qualitative analysis of the 4D seismic data from the Ketzin CO2 storage site (Fig. 8).  By integrating seismic modeling and multiphase fluid flow simulations, we have estimated the impact of the reservoir temperature on the 4D seismic data from Ketzin.  Subsequently, CO2 mass estimations based on reservoir isothermal simulations for both temperature scenarios are compared to those obtained by in situ PNG logging (Ivanova et al., 2012).  This first 3D seismic repeat survey showed a pronounced time-lapse amplitude anomaly at the top of the storage reservoir (Ivandic et al., 2012; Ivanova et al., 2012).\n",
      "Seismic modeling demonstrates significant effects of CO2 on 4D seismic data (Ketzin).  CO2 saturation is insensitive to the reservoir temperature in Ketzin.  CO2 density is considerably lower for the higher reservoir temperature in Ketzin.  Qualitative impact of reservoir temperature is low on 4D seismic data from Ketzin.  Quantitative impact of temperature is considerable on 4D seismic data from Ketzin.  Temperature is one of the main parameters influencing the properties of CO2 during storage in saline aquifers since it along with pressure and co-constituents controls the phase behavior of the CO2/brine mixture.  When the CO2 replaces brine as a free gas it is well known to affect the elastic properties of porous media considerably.  In order to track the migration of geologically stored CO2 at the Ketzin site, 3D time-lapse seismic data were acquired by means of a baseline (pre-injection) survey in autumn 2005 and a first monitor survey in autumn 2009.  During this period the temperature in the storage reservoir near the injection well was observed to have increased from 34°C to 38°C.  This temperature increase led us to investigate the potential impact of temperature on the seismic response to the CO2 injection and on the CO2 mass estimations based on the Ketzin 4D seismic data.  Two temperature scenarios in the reservoir (34°C and 38°C) were studied using multiphase fluid flow modeling.  The simulations show that the impact of temperature on the seismic response is minor, but that the impact of the temperature on the CO2 mass estimations is significant and can, with the help of the multiphase fluid flow simulations, be explained mostly by the impact on the density of the CO2.\n",

      "Summary for Efficient and adaptive congestion control for heterogeneous delay-tolerant networks: The model presented here differs significantly from earlier conceptual models of the storage site (e.g. Hellevang, 2006; Chadwick et al., 2008; Hermanrud et al., 2009, 2010) where researchers have assumed Darcy flow along a pressure gradient via holes in the shale barriers.  The flow of CO2 within the storage site is then simulated with an invasion percolation simulator (Permedia, 2012), assuming percolation as a function of CO2 capillary pressure and shale threshold pressure.  The plume has encountered and breached eight shale barriers within the storage site: seven thin shales that are approximately 1-2m thick, and an uppermost thick shale that is 6-7m thick and geologically similar to the primary seal (Gregersen and Johannessen, 2001; Zweigel et al., 2004).  Percolation occurs when the threshold pressure of the shale barrier is exceeded by the buoyant gas capillary pressure of the trapped CO2 layer (Boettcher et al., 2002; Carruthers, 2003).  While a Darcy flow model requires a rising cascade of fluid through the sandstone and around the shales, via holes or breaks in the shale succession, the approach presented here suggests a simpler hypothesis: the vertical stacking of kilometer-wide and meter-thick CO2 layers that are the result of buoyant gas percolating through the vertical heterogeneity of sandstones and shales found in the Utsira Formation, in a similar manner to hydrocarbon migration and trap charge in petroleum systems, as appropriate for two-phase flow with a low capillary number (England et al., 1987).  Two scenarios with identical geometry were tested by varying the threshold pressure of the shales within Utsira Formation: the first, a base case, assumed that the threshold pressure of approximately 1.6-1.9MPa measured in core recovered from Lower Seal shales (Springer and Lindgren, 2006) is applicable to all shale barriers within the model.  The flow modeling approach and analysis presented here suggest that the shale barriers have uncharacteristically low threshold pressures, enabling the rapid vertical migration of injected CO2 within the storage site.  The Sleipner storage site is not significantly stressed or overpressured at the present day (Wei et al., 1990); the pore fluids are effectively at hydrostatic pressure; and so for Sleipner, the fluid pressure increase necessary to fracture an intact seal (about 10MPa) is highly unlikely.  If the capillary pressure does not exceed the threshold pressure, the fluid will pool beneath the shale and back-fill the shale topography until a spill-point is reached.  As such, above the storage site and inter-layering with it as the 7m thick shale, are the Lower Seal shales of the Nordland Group.  The only published laboratory measurements for the caprock threshold pressure (Springer and Lindgren, 2006; Harrington et al., 2009), from a cored production well, 15/9A-11, close to the storage site, suggest a range of 1.6-1.9MPa, i.e. the fluid pressure necessary for CO2 to break through a low permeability rock.  This three-dimensional model consists of a geological framework of nine alternating intervals of sandstone and shale that extends from the base of the Utsira Formation below the injection point to the primary seal above the storage site.  Reviews of the reservoir geology indicate that this 7m thick shale merges laterally with the Lower Seal, which is considered to be an effective primary seal (Arts et al., 2000; Chadwick et al., 2004).  Evidence against such a fracture network is the continued lateral migration of the uppermost CO2 plume at about 1m per day to the north (Chadwick et al., 2008), and the lack of seismic velocity changes observed in the caprock above the storage site, and within the Middle Seal, on successive 4D seismic surveys (StatoilHydro, 2009; Chadwick et al., 2009).  The modeling indicates that the multiple layers of thin CO2 are likely a consequence of unexpectedly low threshold pressures for vertical migration through the shale barriers within the Utsira Formation.  To obtain multiple layers of CO2, these have either imposed a discrete vertical pathway to by-pass the thin shales within the Formation (Chadwick et al., 2006; Hermanrud et al., 2009, 2010) or assumed a convenient vertical juxtaposition of pre-existing holes (erosional or otherwise) for the eight intra-formational shale barriers.  The areal distribution of CO2 stored within the storage site has been precisely mapped from the seismic surveys (Chadwick et al., 2006; Bickle et al., 2007).  These thin layers occur beneath all three-barrier types: (a) the 1-2m thin shales within the formation; (b) the uppermost 7m thick shale barrier; and (c) the much thicker Nordland Group shale caprock that forms the primary seal.  To better understand the mass balance, spatial distribution and flow behavior of the plume, a numerical flow model of the storage site is constructed.  The properties of the shale and sandstone intervals are constrained by the geological framework of the Utsira Formation and present-day observations from the Sleipner storage site.  The 3D model is calibrated by adjusting the breakthrough threshold pressures of the shales to match published estimates of layer thickness (column heights underlying shale barriers) and the areal distribution for trapped CO2 derived from 4D seismic.\n",
      "Flow model for Sleipner with a plausible layering of CO2 plume and mass balance.  CO2 mass balance analysis for poor temperature and layer thickness constraints.  An unusual capillary flow model, not Darcy flow, results in a successful 3D model.  Low shale barrier threshold pressures indicate pervasive micro-fracturing.  Pre-CO2 fracturing hypothesis based on rapid melting of Pleistocene ice sheets.  To prevent ocean acidification and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, it is necessary to capture and store carbon dioxide.  The Sleipner storage site, offshore Norway, is the world's first and largest engineered waste repository for a greenhouse gas.  CO2 is separated from the Sleipner gas condensate field and stored in the pore space of the Utsira Formation, a saline aquifer approximately 1km below the surface and 200km from the coast.  Statoil, the field operator, has injected almost 1Mt/yr of captured CO2 into the storage site since 1996.  The buoyant CO2 plume ascended rapidly through eight thin shale barriers within the aquifer to reach the top seal in less than three years.  The plume's progress has been monitored by eight seismic surveys, as well as gravimetric and electromagnetic monitoring, which record the spreading of nine thin CO2 layers.  This paper presents a capillary flow model using invasion percolation physics that accurately matches the plume's geometry.  The approach differs from standard Darcy flow simulations, which fail to match the plume geometry.  The calibrated capillary flow simulation indicates that a mass balance for the plume is likely, but can only replicate the plume geometry if the thin intra-formational shale barriers are fractured.  The model enables an estimate of the shale barrier behavior and caprock performance.  The fractures are very unlikely to have been caused by CO2 injection given the confining stress of the rock and weak overpressure of the plume, and so fracturing must pre-date injection.  A novel mechanism is suggested: the deglaciation of regional ice sheets that have rapidly and repeatedly unloaded approximately 1km of ice.  The induced transient pore pressures are sufficient to hydro-fracture thin shales.  The fractures enable fast CO2 ascent, resulting in a multi-layered plume.  Shallow CO2 storage sites in the Northern North Sea and other regions that have been loaded by Quaternary ice sheets are likely to behave in a similar manner.\n",

      "Summary for Impact of temperature on CO2 storage at the Ketzin site based on fluid flow simulations and seismic data: BC1 cells cultured on E8 feeder-free conditions (E8-Matrigel or E8-VNT-N) for at least 3 passages were seeded as a single cell suspension in E8 medium supplemented with Y27632 on the first day (Watanabe et al., 2007).  Moreover, hiPSCs expanded in E8 feeder-free condition showed comparable potential to generate multiple hematopoietic lineages as hiPSCs expanded in MEF culture conditions in the standard colony-forming unit (CFU) assay (Yu et al., 2008; Zhan et al., 2004) (Supplementary Fig. S2c).  Using the spin-EB method (Ng et al., 2008, 2005; Yu et al., 2008) in a feeder- and serum-free condition, we found that on day 14, ~25%-80% of the differentiating hiPSCs were CD34+CD45+ characteristic of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) (Supplementary Fig.  Cells in AD-SF and UL-SF conditions showed 2-3-fold higher expansion rate in the first passage than hiPSCs that were directly thawed in spinner flasks (Fig. 6b).  For in vitro assay, by simply replacing the entire E8 medium with differentiation medium of day-2 spinner flask suspension culture, BC1 and TNC1 aggregates transformed into EBs and started spontaneous differentiation under the stimulation of 10% serum (Supplementary Fig.  After 8days in spinner flask followed by 4days on gelatin-coated tissue culture plates in differentiation medium, cells of all three germ layers could be detected by immunofluorescent staining of specific markers (Fig. 5a).  For iPSCs maintained in suspension in spinner flasks, cell aggregates were washed, and the entire medium was changed from E8 to differentiation medium to induce transformation from cell aggregates to EBs on day 3 after passaging.  To support a robust production of hiPSCs from the bench to a clinical setting, we sought to adapt the cells directly from feeder-free adhesion culture to dynamic suspension culture in spinner flasks.  We found that under the hematopoiesis-inducing condition, leukocyte-like cells emerged around day 10 (Fig. 1d) with 46.8%±1.6% of the cells becoming CD34+CD45+ HPCs (Fig. 1e).  As the inclusion of Y27632 in freezing medium was proven to enhance single cell survival at thaw (Li et al., 2009), we examined cryopreservation of hiPSCs harvested from expansion in bioreactors in E8 medium supplemented with 10% (in volume) DMSO and 10μM Y27632.  To prevent contamination of feeder cells in suspension culture, we first acclimated hiPSCs expanded in conventional mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) culture conditions (Chou et al., 2011) into feeder-free condition.  After treatment with ROCK inhibitor and dissociation, a single cell suspension of BC1 hiPSCs from feeder-free adhesion culture was directly inoculated into the spinner flask with 45ml of E8+Y27632.  BC1 cells expanded in static suspension in E8 medium with an average rate of 3.7±0.9 fold per passage, 3.7×106 fold increase in total with >99% of the cells being TRA-1-60+ after 13 passages (Fig. 1b,c).\n",
      "Large-scale production of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) by robust and economic methods has been one of the major challenges for translational realization of hiPSC technology.  Here we demonstrate a scalable culture system for hiPSC expansion using the E8 chemically defined and xeno-free medium under either adherent or suspension conditions.  To optimize suspension conditions guided by a computational simulation, we developed a method to efficiently expand hiPSCs as undifferentiated aggregates in spinner flasks.  Serial passaging of two different hiPSC lines in the spinner flasks using the E8 medium preserved their normal karyotype and expression of undifferentiated state markers of TRA-1-60, SSEA4, OCT4, and NANOG.  The hiPSCs cultured in spinner flasks for more than 10 passages not only could be remained pluripotent as indicated by in vitro and in vivo assays, but also could be efficiently induced toward mesodermal and hematopoietic differentiation.  Furthermore, we established a xeno-free protocol of single-cell cryopreservation and recovery for the scalable production of hiPSCs in spinner flasks.  This system is the first to enable an efficient scale-up bioprocess in completely xeno-free condition for the expansion and cryopreservation of hiPSCs with the quantity and quality compliant for clinical applications.  We report the first suspension culture of hiPSCs using E8 medium.  We report the first hydrodynamic model for glass-ball type spinner flasks.  We establish a scalable bioprocess in completely defined xeno-free conditions.  We optimized a single-cell cryopreservation for hiPSCs in suspension.  Human iPSCs maintained pluripotency and normal karyotype along the bioprocess.\n",

      "Summary for The Sleipner storage site: Capillary flow modeling of a layered CO2 plume requires fractured shale barriers within the Utsira Formation: As with iPS cells designed to be specific for other diseases, iPS cells generated from patients who were heterozygous for FAP are more useful for elucidating the pathogenesis of FAP: TTR and ATTR in heterozygous FAP form heterotetramers, which produce amyloid, and recombinant TTR forms a homotetramer, which is a totally different form of TTR in plasma and tissues.  The amount of TTR protein was approximately 2.28μg/ml (Fig. 4C), which is comparable with the previous result (0.2-2μg/ml) in functional hepatocyte-like cells differentiated from normal iPS cells (Sullivan et al., 2010), and exhibits 50 times higher than the previous result (0.034-0.057μg/ml) in human hepatocytes in primary culture (Wigmore et al., 1997).  SeV vectors are slowly diluted and disappear during iPS cell division, and SeV vector-positive cells can be removed by means of an anti-SeV-HN antibody (Fusaki et al., 2009).  FAP-specific iPS cells indeed differentiated into hepatocyte-like cells (Shiraki et al., 2008; Shiraki et al., 2011) and expressed Val30Met ATTR.  In this study, hepatocyte-like cells differentiated from FAP-specific iPS cells indeed secreted TTR and ATTR protein in the ratio of almost 1 to 1 as heterozygous ATTR mutant cells (Fig. 5B).  In addition, the PCR-RFLP method showed that hepatocyte-like cells differentiated from FAP-specific iPS cells indeed expressed ATTR Val30Met and wild-type TTR mRNA, similar to expression in the liver of the FAP patient from whom FAP-specific iPS cells were generated (Fig. 5A).  Moreover, LC-MS/MS analysis clearly showed that hepatocyte-like cells differentiated from FAP-specific iPS cells indeed expressed both ATTR Val30Met and wild-type TTR at protein level and the ratio of TTR protein to ATTR protein is approximately 1 to 1 in the D20 culture supernatant (Fig. 5B).  FAP-specific iPS cells had the potential to differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells, a major TTR-producing cell, and indeed expressed ATTR Val30Met and wild-type TTR protein.  Moreover, with the temperature-sensitive SeV vector used in this study, vectors, even if present, could easily be removed after the temperature shift treatment and would not be reactivated in iPS cells (Ban et al., 2011).  Induction of human iPS cells was performed as described previously (Fusaki et al., 2009; Ban et al., 2011).  We next sought to determine whether hepatocyte-like cells differentiated from FAP-specific iPS cells would indeed express TTR.  Thus, although disease-specific iPS cells may help therapeutic research, iPS cells from patients with FAP have not yet been generated.\n",
      "Familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) is a hereditary amyloidosis induced by amyloidogenic transthyretin (ATTR).  Because most transthyretin (TTR) in serum is synthesized by the liver, liver transplantation (LT) is today the only treatment available to halt the progression of FAP, even though LT is associated with several problems.  Despite the urgent need to develop alternatives to LT, the detailed pathogenesis of FAP is still unknown; also, no model fully represents the relevant processes in patients with FAP.  The induction of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells has allowed development of pluripotent cells specific for patients and has led to useful models of human diseases.  Because of the need for a tool to elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of FAP, in this study we sought to establish heterozygous ATTR mutant iPS cells, and were successful, by using a Sendai virus vector mixture containing four transcription factors (Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc) to reprogram dermal fibroblasts derived from FAP patients.  Moreover, FAP-specific iPS cells had the potential to differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells and indeed expressed ATTR.  FAP-specific iPS cells demonstrated the possibility of serving as a pathological tool that will contribute to understanding the pathogenesis of FAP and development of FAP treatments.  We established, for the first time, FAP-specific iPS cells by using a Sendai virus.  FAP-specific iPS cells have potential to differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells.  Hepatocyte-like cells from FAP-specific iPS cells indeed expressed ATTR Val30Met.  FAP-specific iPS cells demonstrate the possibility to serve as a pathological tool.\n",

      "Summary for Scalable expansion of human induced pluripotent stem cells in the defined xeno-free E8 medium under adherent and suspension culture conditions: PGRN secretion from these cells was also ∼50% lower than in control and sporadic FTD cells (Figures S3C and S3D).  Most cells in culture were capable of inducing tetrodotoxin-sensitive action potentials (control: 79.2%; PGRN S116X: 75%), which is consistent with the finding that ∼80% of cells are MAP2-positive neurons (Figure 2G).  Consistent with the results of the cell viability assay, PGRN S116X neurons showed greater caspase-3 activation in response to staurosporine than control or sporadic FTD neurons, whereas tunicamycin increased caspase-3 activity in both PGRN S116X and sporadic FTD neurons (Figure 4D).  Upon differentiation, GRN mRNA levels were ∼41% lower in PGRN S116X neurons than in control and sporadic FTD neurons differentiated from multiple iPSC lines (Figure 3D).  GRN mRNA levels were similar in cells from the control subject and sporadic FTD patient (Figure 3A), but in cells from the FTD patient with the PGRN S116X mutation, the mRNA level was only ∼30% of that found in the control (Figure 3A).  Approximately 40% of the MAP2+ cells were presumably glutamatergic and expressed VGLUT1 (Figure 2H), and <10% of cells were GABA+ inhibitory neurons or tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)+ dopaminergic neurons (Figures 2I and 2J).  This cellular defect appears to be PGRN-independent since PGRN expression levels are normal in sporadic FTD neurons.  Data analysis was aimed at characterizing the gene expression differences between neurons from a sporadic FTD subject and a carrier the PGRN S116X mutation compared to neurons derived from one normal control.  Our finding that neither PGRN S116X nor sporadic FTD neurons show enhanced sensitivity to mitochondrial or oxidative stressors argues that these pathways are unlikely to be affected by reduced PGRN levels in cultured neurons.  The decreased cell viability (Figure 4E) in staurosporine-treated PGRN S116X neurons was rescued by PGRN expression.  We compared PGRN S116X neurons and sporadic FTD neurons versus control neurons, and identified a number of differentially expressed genes, both shared between PGRN S116X and sporadic FTD neurons, and specific to PGRN S116X neurons (Figure 4G).\n",
      "The pathogenic mechanisms of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) remain poorly understood.  Here we generated multiple induced pluripotent stem cell lines from a control subject, a patient with sporadic FTD, and an FTD patient with a novel heterozygous GRN mutation (progranulin [PGRN] S116X).  In neurons and microglia differentiated from PGRN S116X induced pluripotent stem cells, the levels of intracellular and secreted PGRN were reduced, establishing patient-specific cellular models of PGRN haploinsufficiency.  Through a systematic screen of inducers of cellular stress, we found that PGRN S116X neurons, but not sporadic FTD neurons, exhibited increased sensitivity to staurosporine and other kinase inhibitors.  Moreover, the serine/threonine kinase S6K2, a component of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, was specifically downregulated in PGRN S116X neurons.  Both increased sensitivity to kinase inhibitors and reduced S6K2 were rescued by PGRN expression.  Our findings identify cell-autonomous, reversible defects in patient neurons with PGRN deficiency, and provide a compelling model for studying PGRN-dependent pathogenic mechanisms and testing potential therapies.  Progranulin (PGRN) mutations are a common cause of frontotemporal dementia, but the underlying molecular mechanism is unknown.  Gao and colleagues now generate multiple frontotemporal dementia patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell lines and establish a human neuronal model of PGRN haploinsufficiency.  Studies on human postmitotic neurons derived from these lines reveal cell-autonomous and reversible defects in specific signaling pathways that are compromised in PGRN-deficient neurons and establish a model system for studying PGRN-dependent pathogenic mechanisms and testing potential therapies.\n",

      "Summary for Generation of familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy-specific induced pluripotent stem cells: By day 11, placode clusters were negative for PAX6 but retained expression of TFAP2A (Figure 5B), suggesting that early anterior PAX6+ preplacode cells give rise to PAX6-negative posterior placode populations enriched for PAX3+.  Using the placode induction protocol (PIP) >70% of all cells adopt a SIX1+ cranial placode precursor fate by day 11 of differentiation.  Induction of cranial placode markers was observed by day 5 with FOXG1 preceding expression of SIX1 and DLX3 (Figure 1H).  We also observed very few (<1%) NC lineage cells under PIP conditions based on SOX10 expression by immunocytochemistry and SOX10::GFP (Chambers et al., 2012; Mica et al., 2013) reporter line expression (Figure S1F).  Expression of BRN3A confirmed the sensory neuron identity of the cells (Figure S5G).  At day 5, 2 days following Noggin withdrawal (PIP), there was an increase in the number of TFAP2A+ cells (Figure 5B) under PIP conditions and a concomitant loss of TFAP2A+ cells in N-SB (Figure 5C).  About 10% of the surviving human cells expressed ACTH (Figure 6Q) and 6% of the cells were immunoreactive for GH (Figure 6R).  Our findings further delineate the time point of developmental commitment to placodal fate by day 7, given that treatment of cells at day 7 of differentiation (preplacode) induced a switch between various placode fates but did not affect the ratio of cells of placode versus nonneural ectoderm fate.  We observed that under standard PIP conditions most SIX1+ clusters coexpressed PAX3 (Figure 4B), suggesting ophthalmic trigeminal placode identity (McCabe et al., 2004; Stark et al., 1997).  To quantify the induction of lens placode fate, we monitored expression of the lens precursor marker PITX3 at day 16 of differentiation (Figure S6B).  Immunocytochemical analysis of hESC progeny at day 11 of differentiation demonstrated that Noggin withdrawal at day 3 (PIP conditions) induced a switch from 82% PAX6+ neuroectodermal cells under N-SB conditions to 71% SIX1+ putative placode precursor cells under PIP (Figures 1C, 1D, and S1D).  We observed that treatment with agonists for SHH signaling (Figure S7A) at the preplacode stage (days 7-11) induced expression of the oral ectoderm marker SIX6 and PITX1 (Figure 6B), master regulators of pituitary gland development (Tremblay et al., 1998).\n",
      "Cranial placodes are embryonic structures essential for sensory and endocrine organ development.  Human placode development has remained largely inaccessible despite the serious medical conditions caused by the dysfunction of placode-derived tissues.  Here, we demonstrate the efficient derivation of cranial placodes from human pluripotent stem cells.  Timed removal of the BMP inhibitor Noggin, a component of the dual-SMAD inhibition strategy of neural induction, triggers placode induction at the expense of CNS fates.  Concomitant inhibition of fibroblast growth factor signaling disrupts placode derivation and induces surface ectoderm.  Further fate specification at the preplacode stage enables the selective generation of placode-derived trigeminal ganglia capable of in vivo engraftment, mature lens fibers, and anterior pituitary hormone-producing cells that upon transplantation produce human growth hormone and adrenocorticotropic hormone in vivo.  Our results establish a powerful experimental platform to study human cranial placode development and set the stage for the development of human cell-based therapies in sensory and endocrine disease.  Cranial placodes are essential for the development of sensory and endocrine organs.  Here, Studer and colleagues report the efficient derivation of cranial placodes from human pluripotent stem cells.  They demonstrate how to obtain specific placode derivatives such as trigeminal ganglia capable of in vivo engraftment, mature lens fibers, and anterior pituitary cells capable of producing human GH and ACTH in vivo.  Their results establish a platform for studying human cranial placode development and for applications of placode derivatives in regenerative medicine.\n",

      "Summary for Specification of Functional Cranial Placode Derivatives from Human Pluripotent Stem Cells: For example, in young adults with a roving oddball paradigm, Garrido et al. (2008, 2009b) found that the most likely network had bidirectional frontal-temporal connections, with connectivity modulated by the difference between the standard and deviant tones.  However, neurodegeneration not only weakens specific network connections, but can also lead to reorganisation of the networks by enhancing connectivity among the relatively unaffected regions (Seeley et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2010).  In the first model for each of the patient groups the global ACE-r score was entered as the dependent variable and the predictor variables included the mean amplitude of the MMNm (collapsed across deviant types) and the frontal, temporal and parietal interhemispheric connectivity measures from the most likely 'partial' network model.  The change in connectivity, from the sparse network model observed in health to a more distributed network in the patient groups, has two aspects of particular interest.  (Coull et al., 2011) which may explain the delayed response in bvFTD to this specific deviant type, considering the greater extent of frontal atrophy in these patients.  The similar patterns of network connectivity in bvFTD and PSP might be explained by the partially overlapping profiles of prefrontal cortical atrophy and dysfunction in both diseases, despite diverse patterns of underlying neuropathology (Josephs et al., 2006; Mackenzie et al., 2011; Rohrer et al., 2011; Seelaar et al., 2011), although the atrophy is less severe in the frontal lobes of PSP than bvFTD.  A key challenge to understanding the effects of neurodegeneration is to characterise the changing patterns of brain network connectivity, in response to both the disease and its treatment (Pievani et al., 2011; Seeley et al., 2009; Warren et al., 2012).  In contrast, both patient groups were associated with a very different network model as the most likely, given the observed data.  The comparison of model evidences did not distinguish between bvFTD and PSP, at either the family level of network architecture, or at the level of modulation of connections in response to change detection.  Despite minor differences in task and network models, the organisational principles of the likely brain network were similar across studies: sparse and efficient connectivity for change detection.  The sparse intrahemispheric network with modulation of frontal-temporal connectivity was replaced by a widely distributed network with interhemispheric connectivity, and modulation of frontal-parietal and temporal-parietal connections.  Such distributed reorganisation of macroscopic network connectivity, even remote from the regions of direct injury, has been associated with many different neurological conditions including stroke (Sharma et al., 2009), tumour excisions (Rowe et al., 2007) and Parkinson's disease (Rowe et al., 2010).  Secondly, we examined how the most likely network was modulated in response to the deviant vs standard tones.\n",
      "The disruption of large-scale brain networks is increasingly recognised as a consequence of neurodegenerative dementias.  We assessed adults with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and progressive supranuclear palsy using magnetoencephalography during an auditory oddball paradigm.  Network connectivity among bilateral temporal, frontal and parietal sources was examined using dynamic causal modelling.  We found evidence for a systematic change in effective connectivity in both diseases.  Compared with healthy subjects, who had focal modulation of intrahemispheric frontal-temporal connections, the patient groups showed abnormally extensive and inefficient networks.  The changes in connectivity were accompanied by impaired responses of the auditory cortex to unexpected deviant tones (MMNm), despite normal responses to standard stimuli.  Together, these results suggest that neurodegeneration in two distinct clinical syndromes with overlapping profiles of prefrontal atrophy, causes a similar pattern of reorganisation of large-scale networks.  We discuss this network reorganisation in the context of other focal brain disorders and the specific vulnerability of functional brain networks to neurodegenerative disease.  We compare two distinct neurodegenerative syndromes with prefrontal atrophy.  We show both diseases impair the automatic detection of change (MMNm).  Using DCM we discover that both diseases lead to similar network reorganisation.  We suggest principled network reorganisation in response to prefrontal degeneration.\n",

      "Summary for Phialemonium infection complicating chronic suppurative otitis media: Replicating findings from our prior study that used single dipole source localization to examine STG activity (Smith et al., 2010) and now examining a new sample using a different MEG system and applying distributed source localization methods, reduced S1 STG activity was observed in SZ, again supporting impaired encoding of auditory information.  Such abnormalities, perhaps leading to an abnormal spread of activity within cortical auditory areas after auditory stimulation, may explain the reduced STG and PFC activity observed in SZ.  Elevated left SMG activity has been observed during auditory hallucinations in SZ (Diederen et al., 2012; Sommer et al., 2008), with the severity of auditory hallucinations in SZ associated with volume loss in left SMG as well as in left Heschl's gyrus and right IFG (Gaser et al., 2004).\n",
      "Although magnetoencephalography (MEG) studies show superior temporal gyrus (STG) auditory processing abnormalities in schizophrenia at 50 and 100ms, EEG and corticography studies suggest involvement of additional brain areas (e.g., frontal areas) during this interval.  Study goals were to identify 30 to 130ms auditory encoding processes in schizophrenia (SZ) and healthy controls (HC) and group differences throughout the cortex.\n",

      "Summary for Reorganisation of brain networks in frontotemporal dementia and progressive supranuclear palsy: In this way, we represented each subject as a 972-dimension feature vector, including 969 features from the contrast maps after hierarchical clustering and 3 binary features from sedation method.  The SIFT features from sMRI images and region-level features from fMRI images are much less sensitive to registration errors when compared to voxel-features.  For sMRI images, we used SIFT features to represent the brain images and developed an algorithm to analyze the SIFT features.  In the analysis of sMRI data, image features were selected based on their likelihood scores.  Due to the high density of SIFT features in the brain images and the pair-wise comparison among SIFT features required in a later step, analyzing the 3D brain image as a whole is computationally infeasible.  Fig. 7 shows the top 10 functional features extracted from fMRI data that differentiate the HI and NH groups.  In this study, we employed the SIFT algorithm to extract SIFT features from brain structural MR images, and devised an approach for the automatic classification of NH vs. HI based on the SIFT features.  (5)), which requires comparing this feature with all other features.  The second step for feature evaluation was to assign likelihood scores to the SIFT features.  In feature selection, these two ROIs were treated as different features and selected interchangeably.  For a new SIFT feature from a brain image whose class-label is unknown, the corresponding SVM is expected to be able to predict the class label of this new SIFT feature without finding its similar feature set in the huge amount of SIFT features extracted from the brain images used for training.  There were in total 972 features as the input for feature selection.  For the evaluation of a feature, we only calculated its distance to the other features in the same cube.  Specifically, we employed the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm to detect and describe local features in sMRI and extracted region-level features to represent the functional contrast maps.  For example, a feature close to cube boundaries may have some of its similar features (Eq.  There were two steps to evaluate the features, and each SIFT feature was evaluated separately.  The first step was to find all the other features that were similar to the feature that was being analyzed.  An example of SIFT features is shown in Fig. 2.  Different choices of likelihood threshold for the sMRI feature selection resulted in different numbers of selected features and therefore different classification accuracies.  Though this explanation is speculative, it could explain why features B, C, E, F, G, H, and I seem to be more important in separating the HI and NH groups of infants based on brain activation during fMRI.\n",
      "In this research, we developed a robust two-layer classifier that can accurately classify normal hearing (NH) from hearing impaired (HI) infants with congenital sensori-neural hearing loss (SNHL) based on their Magnetic Resonance (MR) images.  Unlike traditional methods that examine the intensity of each single voxel, we extracted high-level features to characterize the structural MR images (sMRI) and functional MR images (fMRI).  The Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm was employed to detect and describe the local features in sMRI.  For fMRI, we constructed contrast maps and detected the most activated/de-activated regions in each individual.  Based on those salient regions occurring across individuals, the bag-of-words strategy was introduced to vectorize the contrast maps.  We then used a two-layer model to integrate these two types of features together.  With the leave-one-out cross-validation approach, this integrated model achieved an AUC score of 0.90.  Additionally, our algorithm highlighted several important brain regions that differentiated between NH and HI children.  Some of these regions, e.g.  planum temporale and angular gyrus, were well known auditory and visual language association regions.  Others, e.g.  the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), were not necessarily expected to play a role in differentiating HI from NH children and provided a new understanding of brain function and of the disorder itself.  These important brain regions provided clues about neuroimaging markers that may be relevant to the future use of functional neuroimaging to guide predictions about speech and language outcomes in HI infants who receive a cochlear implant.  This type of prognostic information could be extremely useful and is currently not available to clinicians by any other means.  We probe brain structural and functional changes in hearing impaired (HI) infants.  We build a robust two-layer classifier that integrates sMRI and fMRI data.  This integrated model accurately separates HI from normal infants (AUC 0.9).  Our method detects important brain regions different between HI and normal infants.  Our method can include diverse types of data and be applied to other diseases.\n",

      "Summary for Frontal and superior temporal auditory processing abnormalities in schizophrenia: Upon neuronal differentiation of the parental TAU-152A/T-iPSCs (Chambers et al., 2009; Hu and Zhang, 2009; Ring et al., 2012), immunocytochemical analysis of TAU revealed unhealthy looking neurons with punctate TAU staining in neuronal processes (Figure 3E).  Importantly, the mutation-related increase in TAU fragmentation in human iPSC-derived neurons was confirmed by western blotting with three different TAU antibodies (TAU-5, TAU-A12, and TAU-C17 that recognize the central core, N terminus, and C terminus of the protein, respectively) (Carmel et al., 1996; Porzig et al., 2007) and was decreased dramatically upon genetic correction of the mutation (Figures 4D-4I).  The TAU-A152T mutation is the first to show the association of a TAU mutation with increased risks for FTD, PSP, and AD (Coppola et al., 2012).  In sharp contrast, the isogenic homozygous TAU-152T/T-iPSCs generated neurons with severe degeneration and a much lower survival of neurons, as indicated by MAP2 staining (Figure 3C), and much more punctate TAU staining in neuronal processes (Figure 3F).  Most strikingly, there was a mutant gene-dose-dependent increase in caspase-cleaved TAU fragments, as determined by the caspase-cleaved TAU-specific antibody C3 (Gamblin et al., 2003; Guillozet-Bongaarts et al., 2005), in neurons derived from the isogenic TAU-A152T-iPSCs (Figures 4J and 4K).  We observed a greater degree of TAU fragmentation, as determined by western blotting using the antibody TAU-5, in neurons derived from TAU-152A/T-iPSCs than those derived from unrelated control iPSCs without the mutation (Figures 4A and 4B).  High-magnification images revealed severe axonal degeneration and fragmentation of neurons derived from TAU-152T/T-iPSCs (Figure 3H), which was completely rescued by correcting the mutation in the isogenic TAU-152A/A-iPSCs (Figure 3G).  However, many glutamatergic (Figure S2V) and GABAergic (Figure S2X) neurons had abnormal morphologies, including neurite fragmentation/degeneration, which were also eliminated by genetic correction of the mutation (Figures S2U and S2W).\n",
      "Tauopathies represent a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the accumulation of pathological TAU protein in brains.  We report a human neuronal model of tauopathy derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) carrying a TAU-A152T mutation.  Using zinc-finger nuclease-mediated gene editing, we generated two isogenic iPSC lines: one with the mutation corrected, and another with the homozygous mutation engineered.  The A152T mutation increased TAU fragmentation and phosphorylation, leading to neurodegeneration and especially axonal degeneration.  These cellular phenotypes were consistent with those observed in a patient with TAU-A152T.  Upon mutation correction, normal neuronal and axonal morphologies were restored, accompanied by decreases in TAU fragmentation and phosphorylation, whereas the severity of tauopathy was intensified in neurons with the homozygous mutation.  These isogenic TAU-iPSC lines represent a critical advancement toward the accurate modeling and mechanistic study of tauopathies with human neurons and will be invaluable for drug-screening efforts and future cell-based therapies.\n",

      "Summary for Combined analysis of sMRI and fMRI imaging data provides accurate disease markers for hearing impairment: The in vivo studies revealed that the serum level of IFN-γ increased at 2 months, and CD45+ cells (including CD8+ cells) accumulated in the allografts 3.5-4 months after the transplant.  Most of the CD45+ cells were CD3+ T cells, and 60% of them were CD8+ killer T cells (Figures 3K and 3L).  The cells were transplanted on day 28 of differentiation.  In the case of iPSC-based transplantation, there are four possible mechanisms that can cause inflammatory and immune responses: (1) direct allorecognition of mismatched MHC or minor antigens of the donor cells, (2) indirect allorecognition through host-derived antigen-presenting cells, (3) expression of fetal antigens due to immature stem cells or remaining transgenes, and (4) mechanical damage rather than MHC mismatch.  In total, 4.8 × 106 cells per animal (8.0 × 105 cells/tract × 6 tracts) were injected into one side of the putamen according to the coordinate decided by the MRI image of each monkey.  To detect the iPSC-derived cells in a brain, we introduced GFP (Figures 1G and 1H).  An increase in the expression of MHC might trigger the recruitment of circulating immune cells, including T cells.  In these cases, the cells from multiple fetuses were used without HLA matching, but more than 50,000 TH+ cells had survived after several years.  In order to assess the immunogenicity of iPSC-derived neural cells in a primate brain, we generated iPSCs from four cynomolgus monkeys and directly compared the autologous and allogeneic transplantation of iPSC-derived neural cells.  Previous reports have suggested that either autologous grafts of iPSC-derived neural cells (Emborg et al., 2013; Maria et al., 2013) or allogeneic grafts of fetal ventral mesencephalic cells (Redmond et al., 2008) can survive in a primate brain without immunosuppression.\n",
      "Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide the potential for autologous transplantation using cells derived from a patient's own cells.  However, the immunogenicity of iPSCs or their derivatives has been a matter of controversy, and up to now there has been no direct comparison of autologous and allogeneic transplantation in the brains of humans or nonhuman primates.  Here, using nonhuman primates, we found that the autologous transplantation of iPSC-derived neurons elicited only a minimal immune response in the brain.  In contrast, the allografts caused an acquired immune response with the activation of microglia (IBA-1+/MHC class II+) and the infiltration of leukocytes (CD45+/CD3+).  Consequently, a higher number of dopaminergic neurons survived in the autografts.  Our results suggest that the autologous transplantation of iPSC-derived neural cells is advantageous for minimizing the immune response in the brain compared with allogeneic grafts.

      "Summary for Genetic Correction of Tauopathy Phenotypes in Neurons Derived from Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells: SOX2+ cells and CDX2+ cells were grown into 3D organoid culture conditions (Spence et al., 2011) known to promote posterior gut differentiation.  For that, heterogeneous endoderm cells generated from the hIPSC lines COXS8, COXV3, and Line4 were grown for 3 additional days in the presence of activin-A to promote foregut specification and the resulting cells were transferred into culture conditions supporting hFSCs expansion.  However, cells expressing mesoderm (Brachyury) or neuroectoderm (N-CAM) markers were never observed and the hindgut marker CDX2 was also absent (Figure 4C) Together, these data suggest that hFSCs have the capacity to differentiate into liver, pancreas, and lung/thyroid cells and thus could be considered as multipotent stem cells.  Importantly, production of foregut cells has been reported previously (Green et al., 2011), but our study provides a culture system allowing the isolation, expansion, and differentiation of multipotent self-renewing foregut stem cells.  Similarly, cells differentiated toward the pancreatic lineage cells expressed PDX1, INS, and NGN3 (Figure 5C).  All flow cytometry experiments were gated first using unstained cells and then cells containing the secondary antibody only.  DE cells were cultured in RPMI+B27 medium with activin-A (50 ng/ml) for 3-4 days to generate foregut cells.  These lines produced less than 30% of SOX17-positive DE cells (Figure 7A).  These stem cells can self-renew in vitro and resemble multipotent cells of the anterior primitive gut tube by their capacity to differentiate into pancreatic and hepatic cells.\n",
      "Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) could provide an infinite source of clinically relevant cells with potential applications in regenerative medicine.  However, hPSC lines vary in their capacity to generate specialized cells, and the development of universal protocols for the production of tissue-specific cells remains a major challenge.  Here, we have addressed this limitation for the endodermal lineage by developing a defined culture system to expand and differentiate human foregut stem cells (hFSCs) derived from hPSCs. hFSCs can self-renew while maintaining their capacity to differentiate into pancreatic and hepatic cells.  Furthermore, near-homogenous populations of hFSCs can be obtained from hPSC lines which are normally refractory to endodermal differentiation.  Therefore, hFSCs provide a unique approach to bypass variability between pluripotent lines in order to obtain a sustainable source of multipotent endoderm stem cells for basic studies and to produce a diversity of endodermal derivatives with a clinical value.  Hannan, Vallier, and colleagues have developed a defined culture system to differentiate and expand human foregut stem cells (hFSCs) from human pluripotent cells.  hFSCs can self-renew while maintaining their capacity to differentiate into pancreatic and hepatic cells.  hFSCs represent a sustainable source of multipotent endodermal cells for basic studies and can produce a diversity of endodermal derivatives with clinical value.\n",

      "Summary for Direct Comparison of Autologous and Allogeneic Transplantation of iPSC-Derived Neural Cells in the Brain of a Nonhuman Primate: IF analysis for NKX2.1, the earliest marker of LPCs distinguishing it from the remainder of the AFE (Fagman et al., 2011; Que et al., 2009), revealed that >90% of GFP+ cells differentiated into NKX2.1+ lung endoderm (Figure 4D).  To investigate if GFP expression could allow for the isolation of NPCs without manual dissection, we dissociated rosette-stage cultures into single cells and isolated GFP+ cells using fluorescence-based cell sorting (Figure 2G).  To test the potential of these cells to develop into LPCs, sorted GFP+ and GFP- AFE cells and unsorted control AFE cells were replated and differentiated to LPCs using previously described methods (Green et al., 2011; Longmire et al., 2012; Mou et al., 2012).  Subsequent culture of GFP+ rosette stage cells revealed that these cells maintained high expression of GFP and the NPC marker SOX1 (Figure 2I).  Finally, IF staining revealed that cultured GFP+ cells maintained high NANOG and OCT4 expression, whereas cultured GFP- cells showed little NANOG or OCT4 expression (Figure 1E).  Additionally, there was no difference in expression of these genes between the CD56+CD271+ and CD56-CD271- AFE cells.  After an initial decrease in GFP expression as cells exited the pluripotent state and differentiated toward DE, a GFP+ cell population re-emerged and expanded during the AFE stage (Figure 4A).  Similarly, gene expression analysis of cells at various stages of differentiation revealed that CD56 and CD271 expression peaked at AFE (Figure S4D).  SOX2, as well as TBX1, expression re-emerged during differentiation to AFE (Figure 3B), but not to PFE (Figure S3B), suggesting the SOX2-GFP reporter line can be employed to isolate cells with properties associated with AFE.  When AFE cells differentiated from WT H9 hESCs were sorted for these cell surface markers, expression of AFE markers SOX2, TBX1, and PAX9 was increased in double-positive cells compared with double-negative cells (Figure 6E).\n",
      "SOX2 is involved in several cell and developmental processes, including maintenance of embryonic stem cells, differentiation of neural progenitor cells, and patterning of gut endoderm.  To study its role in a human system, we generated a human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line harboring a reporter gene encoding GFP in the SOX2 locus.  This SOX2 reporter line faithfully recapitulates expression of the SOX2 gene in undifferentiated human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), neural progenitor cells (NPCs), and anterior foregut endoderm (AFE).  In undifferentiated hESCs, GFP expression corresponds to those cells with highest levels of expression of genes associated with the pluripotent state.  In NPCs, expression of GFP can be employed to isolate cells expressing markers associated with NPC multipotency.  In AFE, we used transcriptome-wide expression analysis to identify cell surface markers with elevated expression in this population, thereby facilitating isolation and purification of this hPSC-derived cell population.  SOX2 is expressed during multiple developmental stages.  Brafman, Willert, and colleagues used human embryonic stem cells carrying a SOX2 reporter to characterize its expression in undifferentiated cells and in neural and lung progenitor cells.  This approach led to the identification of a cell surface signature to isolate prospective lung progenitors.\n",

      "Summary for Generation of Multipotent Foregut Stem Cells from Human Pluripotent Stem Cells: Interestingly, comparisons of the hiPSC methylation signature among hESCs, hiPSCs, and somatic cells revealed that the hiPSCs' methylation pattern often resembled that of somatic cells, except at 12 CpG sites that appeared to be uniquely hypermethylated compared with both hESCs and somatic cells (Figure 1B).  Methylation Levels of 82 Signature Methylation Sites in hiPSCs, hESCs, and Somatic Cells, Related to Figure 1Table S2.  We found that the methylation profiles from 82 CpG sites in 66 genes can effectively group hiPSCs separately from either hESCs or parental somatic cells (Figure 1B; Table S1 available online).  In addition to global hypermethylation, some of the methylation signature sites (n = 12) were also uniquely hypermethylated in hiPSCs, but hypomethylated in both somatic cells and a portion of hESCs (Figure 1B).  To address this issue, we systemically compared the methylation profiles of a large number of human iPSCs (hiPSCs) and hESCs from multiple labs to revisit the question of whether hiPSCs have a unique CpG methylation signature.  By contrast, although we identified a methylation signature using 25 cell lines, we were able to validate these signatures in 249 other samples, demonstrating that our signature comprises a core set of CpG sites that can reliably distinguish iPSCs, hESCs, and somatic cells.  Strikingly, methylation quantitation of the 82 signature sites through bisulfite sequencing could also separate hiPSCs from hESCs with 95% accuracy.  In a data set compiled using the Infinium 450k BeadChip system, we examined DNA methylation in 29 hiPSCs and 18 hESCs (Nazor et al., 2012).  Remarkably, our DNA methylation signature was also able to accurately discriminate between hiPSCs and hESCs regardless of the quantitation platform or technique used.  In differentiation, dynamic DNA methylation changes are critical for lineage specification as a wave of de novo methylation takes place to silence pluripotency genes and establish tissue-specific methylation patterns (Hawkins et al., 2010; Lister et al., 2009; Stadler et al., 2011).\n",
      "Whether human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are epigenetically identical to human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) has been debated in the stem cell field.  In this study, we analyzed DNA methylation patterns in a large number of hiPSCs (n = 114) and hESCs (n = 155), and identified a panel of 82 CpG methylation sites that can distinguish hiPSCs from hESCs with high accuracy.  We show that 12 out of the 82 CpG sites were subject to hypermethylation in part by DNMT3B.  Notably, DNMT3B contributes directly to aberrant hypermethylation and silencing of the signature gene, TCERG1L.  Overall, we conclude that DNMT3B is involved in a wave of de novo methylation during reprogramming, a portion of which contributes to the unique hiPSC methylation signature.  These 82 CpG methylation sites may be useful as biomarkers to distinguish between hiPSCs and hESCs.  Huang et al. identify a panel of 82 CpG methylation sites that can robustly distinguish hiPSCs from hESCs with high accuracy.  Part of the signature consists of aberrantly hypermethylated CpG sites, which are partially abrogated in the absence of DNMT3B.  In addition, DNMT3B-mutant hiPSCs do not exhibit other aberrant hypermethylation signatures as previously reported.\n",

      "Summary for Analysis of SOX2-Expressing Cell Populations Derived from Human Pluripotent Stem Cells: However, we note that, in the study by Bhatt et al. (1994) in which fetal hRPE cell monolayers survived 6 weeks, they removed the host RPE prior to transplantation, indicating that graft survival was not due to the host RPE layer creating an immune- privileged SRS.  We have optimized culture conditions that robustly activate a subpopulation of adult human RPE stem cells (RPESC), expand, and then differentiate them into highly pure RPE monolayers that exhibit physiological features of native RPE (Blenkinsop et al., 2013; Salero et al., 2012).  Here, we show that, similar to fetal hRPE (Liao et al., 2010), adult hRPE cultures can exhibit characteristics similar to native adult human RPE.  With the development of RPE differentiation protocols from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Hirami et al., 2009; Klimanskaya et al., 2004), RPE transplantation has experienced a powerful renaissance, as scientists and clinicians envision an unlimited supply of RPE for transplantation.  The adverse effect of DXP that we observed on xenograft survival was unexpected but perhaps mediated through the RPE glucocorticoid receptor, which promotes RPE proliferation (He et al., 1994).  Fetal RPE cultured in this manner shows morphology and gene/protein expression similar to native RPE, thereby serving as a reference for adult-stem-cell-derived RPE (Liao et al., 2010).  Notably, we find RPE isolated from adult cadaver donors can expand 20-fold and survive as a polarized RPE monolayer for 1 month after transplantation, therefore representing a clinically relevant RPE cell source.  The method for adult RPE culture followed our prior publication (Blenkinsop et al., 2013).  Moreover, fetal and adult hRPE on PET carriers stained positively for the human-specific marker SC121, confirming survival of human RPE for 1 month as a monolayer (Figure 3).  RPE monolayer transplants were placed cell-carrier-side down on intact host RPE, so that the xenografted RPE faced the photoreceptors (Movie S1).  This is encouraging, given that prior studies using RPE cell suspensions showed they failed to survive or function on aged submacular Bruch's membrane (Sugino et al., 2011) and are more likely to be rejected than are RPE monolayers (Diniz et al., 2013).  The RPE monolayer transplant was placed cell-carrier down on intact host RPE within the SRS (Figures 2 and 3; Movie S1).  Here, we demonstrate that polarized human fetal and adult RPE monolayers cultured on a polyester matrix can survive grafting into the rabbit SRS, thus resolving many of the current roadblocks concerning clinical RPE monolayer transplantation.  Adult human RPESC (hRPESC)-derived RPE and fetal hRPE monolayers were compared for their growth characteristics on the carrier PET material.\n",
      "Transplantation of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is being developed as a cell-replacement therapy for age-related macular degeneration.  Human embryonic stem cell (hESC) and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived RPE are currently translating toward clinic.  We introduce the adult human RPE stem cell (hRPESC) as an alternative RPE source.  Polarized monolayers of adult hRPESC-derived RPE grown on polyester (PET) membranes had near-native characteristics.  Trephined pieces of RPE monolayers on PET were transplanted subretinally in the rabbit, a large-eyed animal model.  After 4 days, retinal edema was observed above the implant, detected by spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and fundoscopy.  At 1 week, retinal atrophy overlying the fetal or adult transplant was observed, remaining stable thereafter.  Histology obtained 4 weeks after implantation confirmed a continuous polarized human RPE monolayer on PET.  Taken together, the xeno-RPE survived with retained characteristics in the subretinal space.  These experiments support that adult hRPESC-derived RPE are a potential source for transplantation therapies.  Stanzel et al. have transplanted polarized monolayers of human retinal pigment epithelium (hRPE) grown on polyester membranes derived from adult hRPE stem cells or fetal tissue under the rabbit retina.  The xeno-RPE survived 4 weeks with retained cell polarity characteristics in the subretinal space.  These experiments support that adult hRPESC-derived RPE are a potential source for transplantation therapies.\n",

precipitation may have been the major cause of increased C/N ratios (elevated fluvial runoff) and dinoflagellate cyst changes (lower surface water salinity) at and following the CIE onset in 22/10a-4 (Fig. 9).', 'The gradual lowering of surface water salinity and increase in the C/N ratio from 4m before the CIE onset at 22/10a-4 (above 2618m, Fig. 9), therefore, may also be the result of further uplift and restriction of the North Sea Basin, bringing the coastline and transported terrestrial material into closer proximity to the centrally-located 22/10a-4, although there is no documented sea level fall in the North Sea preceding the CIE (Knox, 1996; Powell et al., 1996).', 'Despite the limitations of this method, the large variation in the %low salinity dinoflagellate cysts (ranging from 0% to 80%) clearly indicates that significant environmental changes in surface water conditions occurred during the CIE onset in the central North Sea, and is supported by coeval changes in the sedimentary carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio (Fig. 10) which reflects changes in the proportion of terrestrial/marine organic material deposited in the North Sea Basin due to terrestrial runoff and productivity (see Section 4.4).', 'The Paleocene-Eocene marker event Apectodinium augustum (Bujak and Brinkhuis, 1998) occurs in 22/10a-4 at 2617.35m (Fig. 3), approximately at the CIE onset (as was

proportion of terrestrial carbon (Fig. 9c), it seems likely that the large reduction in I. hiatus in 22/10a-4 reflects a change in vegetation cover in the source region rather than simply a general reduction in the supply of pollen due to proximity of the coast.', 'Five samples from below the CIE at 2619.60, 2617.35, 2617.44, 2614.73, and 2614.71m (indicated in Fig. 5) contain Apectodinium, in

established, upwelling and diatom production, coupled with the deep regeneration cycle of biogenic opal, trapped silicic acid within a rather stable Southern Ocean \"loop\".', 'Through the late Eocene, between the beginning of our record at ∼38Ma and ∼33.2Ma, diatom δ30Si rose by ∼0.6‰ (Fig. 6c), equivalent to a doubling of silicic acid utilisation in the modern Southern Ocean (Fig. 2a).', 'Together, the diatom and sponge δ30Si records provide the first biogeochemical footprint of major late Eocene diatom expansion and proliferation to near modern levels by the Oi1 event in the Southern Ocean.', 'Silicic acid utilisation is determined by both diatom uptake (broadly reflecting diatom productivity) and silicic acid supply to the surface ocean.', 'Diatom production is characterised by high, rapid particle flux out of near surface waters, a process which enhances labile carbon concentration and organic carbon remineralisation in the deep ocean (Henson et al., 2012).', 'Affirming the link between diatom radiation and late Eocene pCO2 drawdown requires evidence that diatom diversification and opal deposition corresponded to increased diatom productivity and organic carbon burial.',

supply.', 'Site 1090 is situated between the Sub-Antarctic and Sub-Tropical fronts (Gersonde et al., 1999) such that it underlies silicic acid depleted surface waters resulting from extensive diatom

results are somewhat unexpected given previous work (e.g. a pore filling model with PdNPs) [11(b)], and highlights the unusual nature of these porous polysaccharide networks - via the introduction of charged species and growth of CdS nanoparticles within the porous structure, the material porosity adapts, presumably as the flexible soft, biopolymer network adapts its porosity to accommodate the growing CdS phase.', 'Such a reorganisation and restructuring of the polysaccharide phase with increasing CdS loading can potentially be explained by repulsive forces and changes in surface charge as the porous hybrid structure is formed, generating the observed higher total pore volumes and expansion of the corresponding pore size distributions (Fig. 4).', 'Pure control samples of MS and CdS were also prepared to provide comparison.', '35nm is in good agreement with the work of Hillmyer et al. who observed similar blue band edge shifts for CdS nanoparticles prepared using nanoporous polystyrene monoliths as size directing agent, commenting that the blue shift was the result of CdS particle size decrease [20].', 'Given the N2 sorption isotherm profiles and corresponding pore size distributions, it potentially can be inferred that there exists a degree of complimentary, self-organisation and arrangement between the starch gel and forming phase CdS phase during synthesis resulting firstly in an increase in the overall textural \"quality\" in the final porous products.', 'Given the density of CdS (ρ=4.83gcm-3) and that loading is based on 1.0g of the MS support, the actual pore volume of starch support for CdS1, can be estimated as >1.5cm3g-1; notably three times higher than the original MS control sample.', 'With increasing CdS loading, the diffraction patterns

showed in Fig. 3, k1 and ω0 are chosen so that the turbine starts to absorb power at λ=4 for 3 m/s wind speed and maximum CP is still obtained for 6 m/s.', 'The aim of the control strategy is, for each wind speed, to have a stable equilibrium at a rotational velocity that gives a high power coefficient.', 'To tune this strategy for the highest power coefficient at a given wind speed, both λmax and CPmax have to be known at this speed.', 'The investigation here treats control strategies which operate without measurements of the wind speed and where the generator torque is determined from the rotational velocity of the turbine.', 'This paper investigates control strategies where the extracted power is determined from the rotor speed alone, i.e.', 'The simulated performance is only slightly lower than for a reference control strategy with known wind speed.', 'Fig. 1 shows the variation of aerodynamic power, P, with the rotational velocity for a given wind speed.', 'As the power is proportional to the cube of the wind speed, keeping the correct tip speed ratio at high wind speeds is more important, which is the reason for the improved performance of strategies A-C, compared to the reference control strategy, during very rapid wind oscillations.', 'Experiences from the test setup in Marsta [25] indicate that the actual power coefficient at low tip speed ratios is higher than the simulated values, which increases the stability of the control strategy and should therefore not be an issue for the chosen control strategy.', 'If this strategy operates at the stable equilibrium and there is an increase in wind speed, the aerodynamic power will increase, hence P>Pe and the turbine will accelerate until a new equilibrium is reached (compare with Fig. 5).', 'In the low wind speed case at wind frequencies of 0.01-0.03 Hz, the generator efficiency is higher with the reference strategy than with the other strategies, since strategies A-C operate at too high rotational velocities and thereby increase the already dominant core loss.', 'Control strategies A-C are implemented by controlling the load current so that the average of the extracted power Pe from the turbine is as close as possible to the power Pe* prescribed by the applied control strategy.', 'The equilibria in the power plot illustrate the steady state performance while the speed of the control strategy is directly proportional to the difference in torque.'], ['At the time when the mutual topology stops extracting power from turbine 4, the rest of the turbines increase their rotational velocities faster, as the increases in delivered power from turbines 1 and 2 no longer are compensated for by a decrease in power from turbine 4, see Eq.', 'Even though the reduced turbine power absorption for the mutual topology appears significant for both turbines 3 and 4 (see Fig. 6), those two turbines are the ones that deliver the least energy.', 'Therefore, the topology is not as important if the differences in wind speed are caused by mutual turbine interaction, compared to the independent turbines in Section 6.1.', '(3), N is the number of turbines in the farm and ωi is the rotational velocity of turbine i.', 'The significant change in behaviour for the mutual topology at time 1800 s occurs when the turbine that experiences the lowest wind speed (turbine 4) stops delivering power and all turbine power is used to overcome the generator core loss.', 'The control system used with the separate topology works well for independent turbines, but it is not optimised for turbine farms.', \"If the wind speed differences among the turbines are due to the turbines' mutual interaction, the mutual and the separate topologies are almost equal in performance.\", 'For the other two turbines (middle turbines), one is in the wake of the other and it should therefore be a viable strategy to reduce the extraction for the first turbine for a higher power extraction on the second turbine.', 'In the case with significant differences in wind speed between different turbines, it is investigated if the total power for the mutual topology can be increased through modification of the extracted power according to(14)Pe,k=k∑i=1NPe(ωi).', 'For the line configuration, where the turbines are nearly independent, this is disadvantageous as it does not allow each turbine to fully adapt to the changes in wind speed.', 'It was seen in Section 6.1 that for large variations in wind speed between the turbines, the separate topology should perform better, which is seen here.', 'For the square configuration, a rapid increase in wind speed causes the front turbine to obtain a high rotational velocity, which generates a large wake behind the turbine.', 'The aim is instead to show that a simple topology, such as the mutual DC-bus, can be a viable solution for the control of a vertical axis turbine farm as it can obtain relatively good performance without the need for wind speed measurements and additional electrical components.'], ['For the turbine optimisation problem, we wish to maximise a single output (the power extracted) with respect to many input parameters (the positions and tuning parameters of the turbines); this means that the adjoint approach is the natural choice, as the required gradient information can be computed in a number of equation solves that is independent of the number of turbines.', 'Two optimisation runs were conducted, with 128 and 256 turbines respectively.', 'For the turbine optimisation problem considered here, the design parameter m is a vector containing the positions, and optionally the tuning parameters, of the turbines.', 'In all numerical experiments, the optimisation algorithm was initialised with the 32 turbines deployed in a regular 8 × 4 grid and with box constraints for the turbine positions to ensure that the turbines remain inside the site areas.', 'The optimisation was performed without enforcing a minimum distance between the turbines.', 'In all examples, 32 turbines are to be deployed in a rectangular turbine site of size 320 m × 160 m.', 'It fully accounts for the nonlinear interactions between the geometry, the turbines, and the flow throughout the optimisation.', 'To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first application of the adjoint method to the optimisation of turbine

channel experiences an increase in power coefficient compared to a turbine in a free flow and that the peak for the power coefficient occurs at a higher tip speed ratio.', 'In this case, the turbine peaks for a power coefficient of 53.3% for free flow.', \"The study has later been extended by Vennell [32,33], who combined the reduction in flow velocity with a model of how the turbine's efficiency depends on blockage and demonstrated that the maximum power coefficient of the turbine becomes limited due to the reduction of the flow in the channel.\", 'The more general case with a channel of arbitrary width has been studied by Garrett and Cummings [1], and according to their estimates, the maximum power that can be extracted in a channel is(9)Pmax=CP,max12Aρu03(1-ε)2,where A is the turbine cross-sectional area, u0 is the asymptotic flow velocity, ρ is the density and CP,max is the maximum power coefficient for free flow, i.e.', '6 and 9, equation (9) can theoretically be used to estimate the power coefficient for the turbine in free flow if a simulation is performed with channel walls.', 'The power coefficient of the single turbine reference case in free flow can be found in Fig. 1 for four different turbine solidities(12)σ=NbcR.Here, Nb is the number of blades, c is the chord and R is the radius.', 'Compared to the idealized theoretical maximum for channels, the simulations show that the increase in performance due to the channel for a turbine optimized for free flow is smaller than the simple analytical expectation, and this difference increases with increased blockage ratio.', 'In this case, the flow boundaries increase turbine performance [1,2].', 'As the wake of the heavily loaded turbine decreases the flow velocity at the turbine more and drifts away slower due to this lower flow velocity, more revolutions are required.', 'The simulations also indicate that the turbine should be designed differently for the channel case.', 'By looking at the predicted power coefficients of the free flow turbine in Fig. 1, a turbine with σ = 0.12 appears to be a good choice in this case, and the results for this turbine are plotted in Fig. 5 for three different channel widths.', 'With the same convergence criterion as for the free flow and all turbines simulated at optimal tip speed ratio, the convergence for a turbine with σ = 0.12 is given in Fig. 4.', 'For the design of the turbine, the simulations with higher solidities show that when designing a turbine for a channel, the optimal design will be different compared to the free flow case.', 'Additionally, for an open channel flow, there will be an immediate drop in water level over the turbine.'], ['Based on the simulated wind speeds and the model of turbine installed at each

suggested that the load factors of wind farms in the UK have declined by 5-13% per year, normalising for month-by-month variations in wind speeds.', \"This was based on econometric analysis of monthly load factors, using a regression which corrected for the quality of each wind farm's location, the monthly variation in national wind conditions, and the age of each farm.\", 'Four systematic factors determine the actual output of a wind farm: wind speeds at the site, the quality of individual turbine locations (with regards to turbulence and masking), the model of turbine installed and age-related deterioration of performance.', \"In our model, the systematic effect of location-specific wind speeds and turbine model are both incorporated in the ideal load factor data, while the site dummy variables measure the extent to which each farm's surroundings and layout systematically give it more or less wind than the simulation predicts.\", 'When variations in the weather and improvement in turbine design are accounted for, we find that the load factors of UK wind farms fall by 1.57% (0.41 percentage points) per year.', 'If performance declines with wind farm age, we would expect the reported load factor to fall relative to the simulated wind speed over the sample period.', 'The average monthly wind speed at UK onshore wind farms was estimated to be 7.5 ± 1.5 m/s at the location and hub height of each farm, which average 62 m above ground.', 'Figs. 2 and 3 show what has happened to the load factor of these wind farms as they get older.', 'The correlation between

(48-44%) due to three reasons: first due to the SF Cab [45] topology described in Section 5.1, the social utility in CafRep cannot identify nodes that are significantly more central; second as the isolation periods are very high, the nodes cannot offload their content for a very long time; and third as the connectivity periods are very short, the publishing nodes that generate data at a constant rate cause increased dropped packets.', 'As discussed in Section 3, we believe that this higher cost for CafRep in SF Cab trace [45] comes from high weighting of ego network resources and social utility in a trace that does not have node connectivity with good pattern of regularity.', 'As these nodes become overloaded, forwarding to a lower ranked node may lead to more even spread of the network load in the network and lower congestion rates, but also to increased number of intermediaries for the forwarded messages.', 'We proposed CafRep that uses a combined local social, buffer and delay metrics for congestion aware message forwarding and replication that maximises message delivery ratio and availability of nodes while minimising latency and packet loss rates at times of increasing congestion levels.', 'We believe that higher replication rates for CafRep in SF Cab trace [45] are due to CafRep discovering more forwarding opportunities that the other two adaptive replication protocols do not discover.', 'When congestion happens, the combined utility allows CafRep to de-cluster individual nodes and parts of the network by leveraging social metric with resource constraints.', 'Sassy [44] trace is more challenging than Infocom 2006 because it does not include any infrastructure-like nodes (such as semi-static and static nodes such as those deployed during
