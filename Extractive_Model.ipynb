       "'Integrality of the Chern character in small codimension\\n\\nAbstract\\nWe prove an integrality property of the Chern character with values in Chow groups.\\nAs a consequence, we obtain a construction of the p-1 first homological Steenrod operations on Chow groups modulo p and p-primary torsion, over an arbitrary field.\\nWe provide applications to the study of correspondences between algebraic varieties.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nThe Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem of [5] can be expressed as the existence of the homological Chern character, a collection of group morphisms chi:K0′(X)→CHi(X)Q, which are compatible with projective push-forwards.\\nHere X is a (possibly singular) algebraic variety, K0′(X) the Grothendieck group of coherent sheaves, and CHi(X)Q the Chow group of X of algebraic cycles of dimension i, with Q-coefficients.\\nCompatibility with pull-backs is expressed by a Riemann-Roch type formula involving the Todd class.\\nGiven a prime number p, one can formulate the following statement describing a p-integrality property of the homological Chern character. Conjecture\\nLet X be a variety, and n a positive integer. Thenp[n/(p-1)]⋅chdimX-n[OX]∈im(CHdimX-n(X)Z(p)→CHdimX-n(X)Q).\\n The topological analog of this conjecture was stated and proved by Adams in [1, Theorem 1].\\nA more elementary proof of this topological result was later given by Atiyah [4, Theorem 7.1], under the quite restrictive assumption that X is a CW-complex whose homology has no torsion.\\nAlthough our approach is more akin to Atiyah\\'s than Adams\\' (where in particular Steenrod operations were used), no condition of such nature will appear.\\nIn [14, Theorem 4.4], we proved the conjecture for p=2 and n=1.\\nIn the present article, we prove it for n<p(p-1), and any p (Section 3).\\nIn particular we recover the previously obtained result, using an argument of different nature.\\nWe discuss in Appendix how this result can be extended to the more general setting of a scheme of finite type over a regular base.\\nLet us mention that the conjecture is an immediate consequence of the formula expressing compatibility of the homological Chern character with pull-backs when X is smooth, or more generally a local complete intersection variety.\\nThis remark can be used to prove the conjecture in the presence of some form of resolution of singularities.\\nUsing a result of Gabber on existence of regular alterations, we prove the conjecture for all n, when the characteristic of the base field is not p.\\nThe n-th Steenrod operation on Chow groups modulo p is an endomorphism of the Chow group with Z/p-coefficients which lowers dimension of cycles by n(p-1).\\nThe Steenrod operations constitute an efficient tool for studying rationality properties of projective homogeneous varieties.\\nThe classical constructions of the operations modulo p[6-8,21,30] do not work over a field of characteristic p.\\nIn [14], we constructed a weak form of the operation for p=2 and n=1, over any field.\\nWe later obtained the full version of this operation in [16].\\nIn the present paper, we construct a weak form of the n-th Steenrod operation modulo p, for p an arbitrary prime and n=1,…,p-1, over any field.\\nMore precisely, assuming that the conjecture above holds true for n≤m(p-1), and given any (possibly singular) variety X over an arbitrary field, we construct for each integer i such that 0<i≤m, a morphism of graded abelian groups Ti:CH•(X)⊗Z/p→CH˜•-i(p-1)(X)⊗Z/p.\\nHere CH˜d is the quotient of the Chow group CHd by its torsion subgroup.\\nThese morphisms are compatible with proper push-forwards, external products, and extension of the base field.\\nWe also provide a Riemann-Roch type formula expressing compatibility with pull-backs along local complete intersection morphisms.\\nThus we construct operations T1,…,Tp-1 unconditionally, and operations Ti for all i>0 when the characteristic of the base field is not p.\\nThe operation Ti corresponds-up to a sign-to the i-th Steenrod operation modulo p when i≤p.\\nMore generally, the total operation ∑iTi corresponds to the inverse of the total Steenrod operation ∑jSj.\\nWe explain how to recover the operation induced by Sj on reduced Chow groups (the reduced Steenrod operation) from the operations Ti.\\nIn the last part of this paper, we prove the degree formula corresponding to the operations Ti.\\nSince we only proved the conjecture in general for small values of n, we need to work with varieties of dimension ≤p(p-1) (note that the dimension p(p-1) is allowed).\\nWe first give a bound on the p-adic valuation of the index of a projective variety in terms of its dimension and of the Euler characteristic of its structure sheaf.\\nThen we deduce from the degree formula that the Severi-Brauer variety of a central division algebra of prime degree p is strongly p-incompressible.\\nThis is a new statement when the base field has characteristic p.\\nFinally, we show that the Euler characteristic of the structure sheaf of a smooth projective variety of dimension p-1, possessing a special correspondence but no zero-cycle of degree prime to p, is prime to p.\\nThis extends a statement of Rost to arbitrary base fields.\\nNotations\\nVarieties. We fix a base field k.\\nA variety is a finite type, separated, quasi-projective scheme over k.\\nA morphism of varieties is a morphism of schemes over k.\\nWe will denote by V ar/k this category.\\nWe also denote by Proj/k the category with the same objects, but with morphisms only those which are projective.\\nThe function field of an integral variety X shall be denoted by k(X).\\nIntegral elements.\\nFor a number α∈Q, we write [α] for the greatest integer ≤α.\\nLet A be an abelian group.\\nFor any commutative ring R we write AR for A⊗ZR, and, if S is another commutative ring containing R, we write AR⊂S=im(AR→AS).\\nNote that if A is a ring, then AR⊂S is a subring of AS.\\nLet p be a prime number.\\nWhen R=Z(p) (the subring of Q consisting of fractions with denominator prime to p), S=Q, and x∈AQ-{0}, we denote by vp(x) the greatest integer r such that p-r⋅x∈AZ(p)⊂Q.\\nWe set vp(0)=∞.\\nWhen x,y∈AQ, we have vp(x+y)≥min(vp(x),vp(y)).\\nIf A is a commutative ring, M an A-module, a∈AQ, and m∈MQ, we have (1)vp(a⋅m)≥vp(a)+vp(m).\\nGrothendieck groups of schemes.\\nWe denote by K0(-) the presheaf of rings on V ar/k which associates to a variety X the Grothendieck ring of locally-free coherent OX-modules.\\nWe denote by K0′(-) the functor Proj/k→Ab which associates to a variety X the Grothendieck group of coherent OX-modules.\\nHere, and in the rest of the paper, the notation Ab stands for the category of abelian groups.\\nLocal complete intersection morphisms.\\n(See [9, Appendix B.7.6].) These are the morphisms of varieties f:Y→X which can be factored as p∘i, with i a regular closed embedding, and p a smooth morphism.\\nSuch a morphism admits a virtual tangent bundle Tf=i∗[Tp]-[Ni]∈K0(Y), where Tp is the tangent bundle of p, and Ni the normal bundle of i.\\nThis element does not depend on the choice of the factorization.\\nThere are pull-backs f∗:CH(X)→CH(Y) and f∗:K0′(X)→K0′(Y).\\nWe call a variety X a local complete intersection variety if its structural morphism x:X→Spec(k) is a local complete intersection morphism.\\nWe denote by TX∈K0(X) the virtual tangent bundle Tx of x.\\nTopological filtration.\\nLet X be a variety, and d an integer.\\nWe denote by K0′(X)(d) the subgroup of K0′(X) generated by those OX-modules whose support has dimension ≤d.\\nIt coincides with the subgroup generated by elements of type i∗[OZ], where i:Z↪X is a closed embedding, and dimZ≤d.\\nWhen f:Y→X is a projective morphism, we have f∗K0′(Y)(d)⊂K0′(X)(d).\\nWhen f:Y→X is a local complete intersection morphism of relative dimension n, we have [11, Theorem 83 and Lemma 84]f∗K0′(X)(d)⊂K0′(Y)(d+n).\\nThe associated graded group is denoted by grdK0′(X)=K0′(X)(d)/K0′(X)(d-1).\\nThere is a natural transformation of functors Proj/k→Ab(2)φ-:CH(-)→grK0′(-) which respects the gradings [9, Example 15.5].\\nIt is moreover compatible with pull-backs along local complete intersection morphisms, external products, and extension of the base field (see [15, Section 3]).\\nChow cohomology ring.\\nLet X be a possibly singular variety, and consider the operational Chow ring CH(X⟶idX) (see [9, Definition 17.3]).\\nWhen resolution of singularities is available, this ring is commutative [9, Example 17.4.4].\\nWe denote by CH(X) the subgroup of elements x∈CH(X⟶idX) such that for any morphism f:Y→X the element f∗x belongs to the center of CH(Y⟶idY).\\nThe group CH(X) has a natural structure of a CH(X)-module.\\nWe obtain a presheaf of commutative rings CH on V ar/k, in which Chern classes of vector bundles take their values [9, Proposition 17.3.2].\\nWhen E is a vector bundle over a variety X, we write Td(E)∈CH(X)Q for the total Todd class [9, Example 3.2.4].\\nThe individual components are Tdi(E)∈CHi(X)Q.\\nChern character.\\nThe homological Chern character is a natural transformation of functors Proj→Abch:K0′(-)→CH(-)Q.\\nThis is the map τ of [9, Theorem 18.3].\\nIts component of dimension i will be chi:K0′(-)→CHi(-)Q.\\nAdams operations.\\n(See [28]) Let l∈Z-{0}.\\nThe l-th homological Adams operation is a natural transformation of functors Proj→Abψl:K0′(-)→K0′(-)⊗Z[1/l].\\nPart 1.\\nIntegrality of the Chern character\\nWe fix a prime number p.\\nWe say that p-integrality holds in codimension ≤c if the following statement is true.\\nStatement 1.1\\nLet X be a variety and d≥0 an integer.\\nThen for all integers n such that 0≤n≤c, and all elements x∈K0′(X)(d), we havevp(chd-n(x))≥-[np-1].\\n We prove in Section 3 that p-integrality holds in codimension ≤p(p-1)-1.\\nMoreover, we prove in Section 4 that p-integrality holds in codimension ≤m for all m when the characteristic of the base field is not p.\\nWe expect that this assumption is superfluous.\\nAdams operations and Chern character\\nWe fix an element l∈Z-{0}.\\nThe sole purpose of this section is to prove, in Proposition 2.4, the relation for n≥0, (3)chn∘ψl=l-n⋅chn.\\nThis is certainly very classical, at least so is the cohomological counterpart of this statement.\\nDue to the lack of suitable reference, we give some details in this section.\\nWe shall need to introduce some notations, but except in Appendix, the only thing used in the sequel will be the relation (3).\\nCohomological variants.\\nThe cohomological (i.e. usual) Chern character [9, Example 3.2.3] is a morphism of presheaves of rings on V ar/kch:K0(-)→CH(-)Q.\\nThe cohomological (i.e. usual) l-th Adams operation is a morphism of presheaves of rings on V ar/kψl:K0(-)→K0(-), sending the class of a line bundle to its l-th tensor power.\\nWhen X is connected, the ring K0(X) has an augmentation rank:K0(X)→Z sending the class of a vector bundle to its rank.\\nBott\\'s class.\\nConsider the Laurent polynomial in the variable xtl(x)=1-xl1-x.\\nThere is a unique morphism of presheaves of abelian groups on V ar/kθl:K0(-)→(Z[1/l]⊗K0(-))× such that for all line bundles L, θl(L)=tl[L∨].\\nNote that this does not follow [28], where θl(L)=tl[L].\\nK-theory with supports.\\nWhen X is a closed subvariety of a variety W, the notation K0X(W) stands for the Grothendieck group of complexes of locally free OW-modules, which are acyclic off X, modulo the classes of acyclic complexes.\\nIt has a natural structure of a K0(W)-module.\\nWe denote by CH(X→W) the bivariant Chow group (see [9, Definition 17.1]).\\nThere are maps -∩[OW]:K0X(W)→K0′(X),-∩[W]:CH(X→W)→CH(X) which are isomorphisms when W is smooth ([12, Lemma 1.9] and [9, Proposition 17.4.2]).\\nWe write chXW:K0X(W)→CH(X→W)Q for the local Chern character [9, Section 18.1], and ψXl:K0X(W)→K0X(W) for the Adams operation with supports [12, Section 4].\\nAssume that W is smooth, and that x∈K0X(W).\\nThen the homological Chern character is given by the formula [9, Theorem 18.3, (3)], (4)ch(x∩[OW])=(Td(TW)⋅chXW(x))∩[W], while homological Adams operations are defined by the formula [28, Théorème 7](5)ψl(x∩[OW])=(θl(-TW)⋅ψXl(x))∩[OW].\\nComposing the maps chXW with projections CH(X→W)Q→CHj(X→W)Q, we obtain individual components (chXW)j.\\nWe now prove a few lemmas that will be used to obtain (3).\\nLemma 2.1\\nLet X be a connected variety.\\nWe have in CH(X)Q, for all u∈K0(X),Td(-u)⋅ch∘θl(u)=lrank(u)⋅Td(-ψl(u)).\\nProof\\nAssume that L is a line bundle.\\nThen ch∘θl(L)=ch(tl[L∨])=tl(ch[L∨])=tl(x-1)=1-x-l1-x-1, where x=ec1(L).\\nThen Td(-L)⋅ch∘θl(L)=1-x-1c1(L)⋅1-x-l1-x-1=1-x-lc1(L)=l⋅1-e-c1(L⊗l)c1(L⊗l)=l⋅Td(-L⊗l).\\nThus the claimed formula holds when u is the class of a line bundle.\\nBoth sides of this formula define morphisms of presheaves of abelian groups on V ar/kK0(-)→(CH(-)Q)×.\\nTherefore, we can conclude with the splitting principle. □\\nLemma 2.2\\nLet X be a variety.\\nWe have in CH(X)Q, for all u∈K0(X),Td(ψl(-u))=∑i≥0li⋅Tdi(-u).\\nProof\\nFor a line bundle L, we have Td(-L⊗l)=∑i≥0(-c1(L⊗l))i(i+1)!=∑i≥0li⋅(-c1(L))i(i+1)!=∑i≥0li⋅Tdi(-L), proving the formula for u the class of a line bundle.\\nThe lemma follows as above from the splitting principle. □\\nLemma 2.3\\n[19, Theorem 3.1]\\nLet X be a closed subvariety of a smooth variety W . We have in CH(X→W)Q, for x∈K0X(W),chXW(ψXl(x))=∑j≥0lj⋅(chXW)j(x).\\nProposition 2.4\\nLet n≥0 be an integer.\\nWe have chn∘ψl=l-n⋅chn.\\nProof\\nIt will be enough to prove that the two sides of the formula have the same effect on any element of K0′(X), for X a connected variety.\\nChoose a closed embedding X↪W into a smooth connected variety W of dimension d.\\nThen, we have in CH(X)Q, for all x∈K0X(W), ch∘ψl(x∩[OW])=Td(TW|X)⋅(chXW(θl(-TW)⋅ψXl(x))∩[W])=(Td(TW|X)⋅ch∘θl(-TW|X))⋅(chXW(ψXl(x))∩[W])=l-d⋅Td(ψl(TW|X))⋅(chXW(ψXl(x))∩[W])=∑i=0dli-d⋅Tdi(TW|X)⋅∑j≥0lj⋅((chXW)j(x)∩[W])=∑n=0dl-n⋅∑i+j=d-nTdi(TW|X)⋅((chXW)j(x)∩[W])=∑n=0dl-n⋅chn(x∩[OW]).\\nThe first equality is (4) and (5).\\nThe second follows from [9, Proposition 18.1, (c)].\\nFor the third one, we use Lemma 2.1.\\nThe fourth one uses Lemmas 2.2 and 2.3.\\nThe last one is again (4). □\\nIntegrality in arbitrary characteristic\\nProposition 3.1\\nLet l∈Z-{0}, X a variety, and x∈K0′(X)(d) . Thenψl(x)-l-d⋅x∈K0′(X)(d-1)⊗Z[1/l].\\nProof\\nWhen l=p is a prime number, this is [15, Lemma 6.1].\\nActually we obtained this result using the formula θp(-d)=p-d,(d∈Z), which is true when p is an arbitrary element of Z-{0}.\\nTherefore, we can obtain the proposition using the proof of [15, Lemma 6.1].\\nAlternatively, one can assume that X is integral and d=dimX.\\nThen we have an exact sequence 0→K0′(X)(d-1)⊗Z[1/l]→K0′(X)(d)⊗Z[1/l]→K0′(Spec(k(X)))⊗Z[1/l]→0, and the statement is a consequence of [16, Lemma 4.2]. □\\nTheorem 3.2\\np-integrality holds in codimension ≤p(p-1)-1.\\nProof\\nWe must prove Statement 1.1 with c=p(p-1)-1.\\nFor all d, the case n=0 immediately follows from [9, Theorem 18.3, (5)].\\nIn particular, the theorem is proved when d=0.\\nWe can therefore proceed by induction on d, and assume that n>0.\\nFor all i≥1, define an integer ap(i)={1 if p-1|i0 otherwiseso that we have (6)[np-1]=[n-1p-1]+ap(n).\\nSince 0<n<p(p-1), we can use Lemma 3.3 below to choose an integer l, prime to p, such that (7)vp(ln-1)=ap(n).\\nWrite, in K0′(X)⊗Z[1/l], using Proposition 3.1, ψl(x)=l-d⋅x+l-d-m⋅α with α∈K0′(X)(d-1), and m≥0.\\nThen applying ld+m⋅chd-n to the relation above, and using Proposition 2.4, we obtain in CHd-n(X)Qlm⋅(ln-1)⋅chd-n(x)=chd-n(α).\\nBecause of (7), we get vp(chd-n(x))=vp(chd-n(α))+ap(n).\\nWe conclude using (6) and the induction hypothesis for α∈K0′(X)(d-1). □\\nLemma 3.3\\nLet p be a prime number.\\nThen there exists an integer l, prime to p, with the following properties(a)\\nIf n is not divisible by p-1, then ln-1 is not divisible by p.\\n(b)\\nIf n is not divisible by p(p-1), then ln-1 is not divisible by p2.\\nProof\\nTake for l an integer whose class modulo p2 generates the cyclic group (Z/p2)×.\\nThen one checks easily that the class of l modulo p generates the cyclic group (Z/p)×. □\\nRemark 3.4\\nIn contrast with [14] where the normalization procedure was used, we do not use geometric arguments here.\\nWe only use basic relations between Adams operations, Chern character, and filtration on K-theory.\\nUsing [3, (1.5)] in place of Proposition 3.1, and [2, Theorem 5.1, (vi)] in place of Proposition 2.4, one could proceed as above to replace the assumption \"X is without torsion\" by \"n<p(p-1)\" in [4, Theorem 7.1], thus giving an elementary proof of the p-primary part of [1, Theorem 1], for small n.\\nNote also that the approach of [14] is limited by nature to schemes whose normalization morphism is of finite type, while Theorem 3.2 is valid for more general schemes (see Appendix).\\nConsequences of Gabber\\'s Theorem\\nIn this section, we use the theorem of Gabber asserting that, over a field of characteristic different from p, any integral variety X admits a regular alteration of degree prime to p.\\nThis means that there exists a projective morphism Z→X, generically finite of degree prime to p, with Z regular.\\nSome details can be found in [10,17].\\nIf d≥0 is an integer, the d-th Todd number is (8)τd=∏p primep[d/(p-1)].\\nProposition 4.1\\nLet X be a local complete intersection variety.\\nThen, for all nτn⋅chdimX-n[OX]∈CH(X)Z⊂Q.\\nProof\\nLet x:X→Spec(k) be the structural morphism of X.\\nThen by [9, Theorem 18.3, (4) and (5)], ch[OX]=ch∘x∗[OSpec(k)]=Td(TX)⋅x∗∘ch[OSpec(k)]=Td(TX)⋅[X].\\nThen the proposition follows from Lemma 6.3 below. □\\nTheorem 4.2\\nLet p be a prime different from the characteristic of the base field.\\nThen p-integrality holds in codimension ≤c, for any c.\\nProof\\nWe must prove Statement 1.1 with c arbitrary large.\\nWe proceed by induction on d, the case d=0 being obvious.\\nIt is enough to consider the case X integral of dimension d, and x=[OX].\\nUsing Gabber\\'s theorem, we choose f:Z→X a projective morphism, with Z a regular connected variety of dimension d, and such that [k(Z):k(X)]=λ is prime to p.\\nThen there is an element δ∈K0′(X)(d-1) such that f∗[OZ]=λ⋅x+δ.\\nThus vp(chd-n(x))≥min(vp(f∗chd-n[OZ]),vp(chd-n(δ)))≥min(vp(chd-n[OZ]),vp(ch(d-1)-(n-1)(δ))).\\nWe conclude using Proposition 4.1 for Z, and the induction hypothesis on δ. □\\nThe combination of Theorems 3.2 and 4.2 implies the following.\\nCorollary 4.3\\nLet X be a variety over a field of characteristic p, and d be an integer.\\nThen for all integers n such that 0≤n<p(p-1), and all elements x∈K0′(X)(d), we haveτn⋅chd-n(x)∈CH(X)Z⊂Q.\\nPart 2.\\nOperations on Chow groups\\nConstruction\\nWe proceed as in [14] to derive operations from the integrality property of the Chern character stated above.\\nThis follows [4, Section 7].\\nLet A be an abelian group.\\nThen the natural map (9)AZ⊂Q⊗Z/p→AZ(p)⊂Q⊗Z/p, is an isomorphism.\\nThis group can also be described as A modulo p and p-primary torsion.\\nBy this we mean the quotient of A by p⋅A+T, where T is the subgroup of elements a∈A such that pn⋅a=0 for some integer n>0.\\nWe assume that p-integrality holds in codimension ≤m(p-1), for some integer m.\\nLet q>0 be an integer.\\nFor every integer i such that 0<i≤m, we see using Statement 1.1, for d=q and n=i(p-1), that the association x↦pi⋅chq-i(p-1)(x) induces a natural transformation of functors Proj→AbK0′(-)(q)→CHq-i(p-1)(-)Z(p)⊂Q.\\nLet X be a variety, and x∈K0′(X)(q-1)⊂K0′(X)(q).\\nThen pi⋅chq-i(p-1)(x)=p⋅(pi-1⋅ch(q-1)-(i(p-1)-1)(x)).\\nUsing Statement 1.1 for d=q-1 and n=i(p-1)-1, we see that this element belongs to p⋅CHq-i(p-1)(X)Z(p)⊂Q.\\nThis gives a natural transformation of functors Proj→AbgrqK0′(-)⊗Z/p→CHq-i(p-1)(-)Z(p)⊂Q⊗Z/p.\\nComposing on the left with the map (2), and on the right with the inverse of the map (9) with A=CHq-i(p-1)(-), we obtain a natural transformation of functors Proj→AbTi:CHq(-)⊗Z/p→CHq-i(p-1)(-)Z⊂Q⊗Z/p.\\nIt will be convenient to agree that T0:CHq(-)⊗Z/p→CHq(-)Z⊂Q⊗Z/p is the quotient map modulo the image modulo p of p-primary torsion.\\nThe inverse Todd genus\\nWe consider the power series in the variable x(10)R(p)(x)=∑i=0∞(-1)i⋅xpi-1.\\nThere is a unique morphism of presheaves of abelian groups on V ar/kr(p):K0(-)→(CH(-)⊗Z/p)× such that for L a line bundle, r(p)(L)=R(p)(c1(L)).\\nIndividual components are denoted ri(p):K0(-)→CHi(p-1)(-)⊗Z/p.\\nUsing the terminology of [24], this class will be the inverse Todd genus of the operation T=∑iTi constructed in the previous section.\\nIn this section we describe a relation between the characteristic class r(p) and the Todd class.\\nRemark 6.1\\nThe inverse Todd genus of the usual Steenrod operation ∑iSi is defined by the power series W(p)(x)=1+xp-1.\\nOne easily checks that x⋅R(p)(x) is the left inverse of x⋅W(p)(x) for the law given by composition of power series with coefficients in Z/p.\\nWe begin by stating an easy argument that we will use repeatedly below.\\nLemma 6.2\\nLet A be a commutative ring, M an A-module, au∈AQ and mu∈MQ for u=0,…,i(p-1) satisfyingvp(au)≥-[up-1]andvp(mu)≥-[up-1].Then we have an equality in MZ(p)⊂Q⊗Z/p,∑u=0i(p-1)(pi⋅au⋅mi(p-1)-u)=∑j=0i(pj⋅aj(p-1))⋅(pi-j⋅m(i-j)(p-1)).\\nProof\\nWe compute, for all u, using (1), vp(au⋅mi(p-1)-u)≥vp(au)+vp(mi(p-1)-u)≥-[up-1]-[i(p-1)-up-1]=-[up-1]-i-[-up-1].\\nThis integer is always ≥-i; hence the elements delimited by the parentheses in the formula of the statement belong to the submodule MZ(p)⊂Q⊂MQ.\\nMoreover, when u is not divisible by p-1, this integer is >-i.\\nThis gives the requested formula modulo p. □\\nLemma 6.3\\nWe have, for all integers n, and all x∈K0(X)vp(Tdn(x))≥-[np-1].\\nProof\\nLet X be a variety.\\nThen the set of elements 1+y with y∈⨁n>0p-[n/(p-1)]⋅CHn(X)Z(p)⊂Q is a subgroup B(X) of (CH(X)Q)×.\\nIf f:Y→X is a morphism of varieties, then f∗B(X)⊂B(Y).\\nThus we can define a presheaf of abelian groups C on V ar/k by C(-)=(CH(-)Q)×/B(-).\\nWe have a morphism of presheaves of abelian groups on V ar/kν:K0(-)→C(-),x↦Td(-x).\\nWhen L is a line bundle, we have by definition of the Todd class, ν[L]=∑n≥0(-c1(L))n(n+1)!.\\nThen ν vanishes on the classes of line bundles, because of Lemma 6.5 below.\\nThe splitting principle allows us to conclude.11\\nIf f:Y→X is a projective bundle, one can check that the pull-back C(X)→C(Y) is injective using the fact that f∗:CH(X)→CH(Y) is a split monomorphism.\\n□\\nProposition 6.4\\nLet j≥0 be an integer, X a variety, and x∈K0(X) .\\nThen the elements pj⋅Tdj(p-1)(-x) and rj(p)(x) have same image inCHj(p-1)(X)Z(p)⊂Q⊗Z/p.\\nProof\\nWe consider the presheaf of commutative rings on V ar/kCH˜(-)=CH(-)Z(p)⊂Q⊗Z/p.\\nThe characteristic class r(p) induces a morphism of presheaves of abelian groups on V ar/kr(p)˜:K0(-)→CH˜(-)×.\\nBy Lemma 6.3, we can consider the association ρ:K0(-)→CH˜(-),x↦∑j≥0pj⋅Tdj(p-1)(-x).\\nIt is clearly compatible with arbitrary pull-backs.\\nIt sends sums to products because the total Todd class has the same property, and because of Lemmas 6.2 and 6.3.\\nLet L be a line bundle.\\nThen by definition of the Todd class, we have ρ[L]=∑j≥0pj(j(p-1)+1)!⋅(-c1(L))j(p-1).\\nUsing Lemma 6.5 below, we see that the j-th coefficient is an element of Z(p).\\nMoreover, we see that it belongs to pZ(p) if and only if j(p-1)+1 is not a power of p.\\nOtherwise, when say j(p-1)+1=pi, we see using Lemma 6.6 below, that the j-th coefficient is (-1)i modulo pZ(p).\\nIn view of (10), the characteristic class ρ coincides with r(p)˜ on the classes of line bundles, and the claim follows from the splitting principle. □\\nLemma 6.5\\n[20, p.10]\\nLet p be a prime number, and n a positive integer.\\nLet s be the sum of the digits appearing in the expression of n in base p . Thenvp(n!)=n-sp-1.\\nLemma 6.6\\nLet i≥0 be an integer, and p a prime number.\\nWe have(pi)!⋅p-pi-1p-1=(-1)imodp.\\nProof\\nWe proceed by induction on i.\\nFor i=0 this is immediate.\\nLet i≥1 and consider the set Ui={1,2,…,pi-1,pi}.\\nThe product of all the integers sitting between two consecutive multiples of p is congruent to -1 modulo p, by Wilson\\'s Theorem.\\nThus the product of all elements of Ui which are non-divisible by p is congruent modulo p to (-1)pi-1=-1.\\nThe product of the pi-1 elements of Ui which are divisible by p is ppi-1⋅(pi-1)!.\\nHence we have (pi)!⋅p-pi-1p-1=(-1)⋅ppi-1⋅(pi-1)!⋅p-pi-1p-1=-p-pi-1-1p-1⋅(pi-1)!.\\nBy the induction hypothesis, this is (-1)i, as requested. □\\nProperties\\nLet p be a prime number.\\nIn this section, we assume that integrality holds in codimension ≤m(p-1), and describe some functorial properties of the operations T0,…,Tm constructed in Section 5.\\nProposition 7.1\\nLet f:Y→X be a local complete intersection morphism.\\nLet i be an integer such that 0≤i≤m . Then we haveTi∘f∗=∑j=0irj(p)(-Tf)⋅f∗∘Ti-j.\\nProof\\nWe have, by [9, Theorem 18.3, (4)], chn-i(p-1)∘f∗=∑u=0i(p-1)Tdu(Tf)⋅f∗∘chn-i(p-1)+u.\\nIn view of Lemmas 6.3 and 6.2 and Theorem 3.2, we have, in the group CHn-i(p-1)(Y)Z(p)⊂Q⊗Z/p, pi⋅chn-i(p-1)∘f∗=∑j=0i(pj⋅Tdj(p-1)(Tf))⋅f∗∘(pi-j⋅chn-(i-j)(p-1)).\\nSince the map (2) is compatible with f∗, Proposition 6.4 allows us to conclude. □\\nApplying Proposition 7.1 to the structural morphism of a local complete intersection variety, we obtain the formula computing the effect of the operation Ti on regular cycles.\\nCorollary 7.2\\nLet X be a local complete intersection variety (e.g. a regular variety).\\nLet i be an integer such that 0≤i≤m . ThenTi[X]=ri(p)(-TX)⋅[X].\\nProposition 7.3\\nLet X and Y be two varieties over the same field.\\nThen for x∈CHd(X), and y∈CHe(Y), and 0≤i≤m, we haveTi(x×y)=∑j=0iTj(x)×Ti-j(y).\\nProof\\nLet a∈K0′(X)(d) (resp.\\nb∈K0′(X)(e)) be an element such that φX(x)=amodK0′(X)(d-1) (resp.\\nφY(y)=bmodK0′(Y)(e-1)), where φ- is the map (2).\\nWe have, by [9, Example 18.3.1] (and [9, Theorem 18.3, (5)]) chd+e-i(p-1)(a×b)=∑u=0i(p-1)chd-u(a)×che+u-i(p-1)(b).\\nBy Lemma 6.2, this gives in CHd+e-i(p-1)(X×Y)Z(p)⊂Q⊗Z/p, pi⋅chd+e-i(p-1)(a×b)=∑j=0i(pj⋅chd-j(p-1)(a))×(pi-j⋅che-(i-j)(p-1)(b)).\\nWe can conclude using the fact that φ is compatible with external products. □\\nAssume that X is a local complete intersection variety.\\nDefine, for i≤m, the i-th cohomological operation Ti by the formula Ti=∑j=0irj(p)(TX)⋅Ti-j:CH•(X)→CH•-i(p-1)(X)Z⊂Q⊗Z/p.\\nProposition 7.4\\nLet X and Y be local complete intersection varieties over a common field, and i an integer such that 0<i≤m.(i)\\nFor x∈CH(X),y∈CH(Y), we haveTi(x×y)=∑j=0iTj(x)×Ti-j(y).\\n(ii)\\nWhen X is smooth, x,y∈CH(X), we haveTi(x⋅y)=∑j=0iTj(x)⋅Ti-j(y).\\n(iii)\\nThe operation T0 is the identity.\\n(iv)\\nTi[X]=0.\\n(v)\\nAssume that X is smooth, and let x∈CH1(X) .\\nThen Ti(x)=-xp if i=1, and Ti(x)=0 otherwise.\\n(vi)\\nIf f:Y→X is a local complete intersection morphism, then Ti∘f∗=f∗∘Ti.\\n(vii)\\nLet f:Y→X be a projective morphism.\\nLet Tf=TY-f∗TX∈K0(Y) . ThenTi∘f∗=f∗∘∑j=0irj(p)(-Tf)⋅Ti-j.\\nProof\\nStatement (i) follows from Proposition 7.3, statement (vi) from Proposition 7.1, and (vii) from the fact that the operations Ti are compatible with projective push-forwards.\\nThen (ii) follows from (i) and (vi), statement (iv) from (vi) and the obvious computation for X=Spec(k).\\nStatement (iii) is a consequence of the definition of T0.\\nWe now prove (v).\\nWe can assume that x=[Z] for some integral closed subvariety Z of X.\\nSince X is locally factorial, Z is a locally principal divisor.\\nIn particular, the closed embedding f:Z↪X is regular, and Z is a local complete intersection variety.\\nThen, using (iv) and (vii), where Tf=-f∗[OX(Z)], we obtain for i>0, Ti(x)=Ti∘f∗[Z]=f∗∘Ti[Z]-f∗(c1(f∗[OX(Z)])p-1⋅Ti-1[Z])=-c1(OX(Z))p-1⋅f∗∘Ti-1[Z].\\nThis is zero when i>1 by (iv).\\nWhen i=1, this is, by (iii), -c1(OX(Z))p-1⋅[Z]=-c1(OX(Z))p=-xp, as requested. □\\nFinally, we mention the following.\\nProposition 7.5\\nLet L/k be a field extension.\\nThen, for all varieties X, all x∈CH(X), and i such that 0≤i≤m, we haveTi(xL)=Ti(x)L.\\nProof\\nThis follows from [14, (2) and Theorem 3.1, (d)]. □\\nRelation with Steenrod operations\\nIn this section, we compare the operations Ti with the Steenrod operations constructed by other methods.\\nWe therefore make the assumption that the characteristic of the base field is different from p.\\nConsider the i-th homological Steenrod operation of, say, [7]Si:CH•(-)⊗Z/p→CH•-i(p-1)(-)⊗Z/p, and write S=∑iSi.\\nSince S0=id, we have S=id+f, where for every variety X the induced endomorphism fX of CH(X)⊗Z/p is nilpotent.\\nWe write T′X for the left inverse of SX; this defines a natural transformation of functors V ar/k→Ab with components Ti′:CH•(-)⊗Z/p→CH•-i(p-1)(-)⊗Z/p.\\nWe have T0′=id and, for i>0, one can express Ti′ inductively as (11)Ti′=-∑j=1iTi-j′∘Sj.\\nProposition 8.1\\nWe have for i≤pTi′=(-1)i⋅Si.\\nProposition 8.2\\nAssume that X is a smooth variety. ThenT′[X]=r(p)(-TX)[X].\\nProof\\nProof of Propositions 8.1 and 8.2\\nLet Z be a variety.\\nIt is proven in [22, Lemma 5.2 and Proposition 3.1] that the homological Steenrod operations S• induce an action of the Steenrod Z/p-algebra S on CH(Z)⊗Z/p.\\nThe operation Sj acts as the element Pj∈S (in case p=2 we write Pj for Sq2j).\\nUsing (11), we see that the action of Tj′ on CH(Z)⊗Z/p coincides with the action of the conjugate c(Pj) of Pj, in the sense of [23, Section 7].\\nLet bi for i∈N-{0} be indeterminates.\\nIf R=(r1,r2,…) is a sequence of non-negative integers, we write bR for the product b1r1b2r2⋯.\\nBy [23, Corollary 6], the morphism S[[b1,b2,…]]→S[[x]],bi↦(-1)pi-1p-1⋅xpi-1=(-1)i⋅xpi-1modp sends the total Steenrod operation ∑RPR⋅bR to ∑jc(Pj)⋅xj(p-1).\\nWe obtain Proposition 8.1 by noticing that for i≤p the element Pi is the only basis element of type PR of the same dimension as c(Pi).\\nMoreover, by [22, Proposition 5.3, (2)], we obtain T′[X]=d(-TX)[X], where d is the total Chern class ∑RcR⋅bR evaluated at bi=(-1)i.\\nInspection of the value of d on a line bundle reveals that d=r(p), establishing Proposition 8.2. □\\nProposition 8.3\\nAssume that the base field is of characteristic different from p . Let i be any integer ≥0 . Then we have a commutative diagram\\nProof\\nBy Lemma 8.4 below and Proposition 7.5, we can assume that the base field is perfect.\\nSince both operations are compatible with proper push-forwards, it will be enough to compare their values in CHd-i(p-1)(X)Z⊂Q⊗Z/p on the class [X], when X is an integral variety of dimension d.\\nUsing Gabber\\'s theorem, we find a projective morphism f:Z→X, with Z smooth of dimension d, and f dominant with [k(Z):k(X)]=λ an integer prime to p.\\nLet ν∈(Z/p)× be the inverse modulo p of λ.\\nThen, using Corollary 7.2, Ti[X]=ν⋅Ti(λ⋅[X])=ν⋅Ti∘f∗[Z]=ν⋅f∗∘Ti[Z]=ν⋅f∗(ri(p)(-TZ)⋅[Z]).\\nA similar computation, and Proposition 8.2, show that Ti′[X] has the same value, as requested.□\\nLemma 8.4\\nLet X be a variety over a field k of characteristic ≠p . Let F/k be a perfect closure.\\nThen scalars extension induces an injective morphismCH(X)Z⊂Q⊗Z/p→CH(XF)Z⊂Q⊗Z/p.\\nProof\\nLet L/k be a finite field extension.\\nA transfer argument shows that CH(X)Q→CH(XL)Q is injective, hence so is CH(X)Z⊂Q→CH(XL)Z⊂Q, and therefore so is CH(X)Z⊂Q⊗Z(p)→CH(XL)Z⊂Q⊗Z(p).\\nWhen the degree of the extension L/k is prime to p, the transfer induces a splitting of this monomorphism, so that CH(X)Z⊂Q⊗Z/p→CH(XL)Z⊂Q⊗Z/p is injective.\\nBy [29, Theorem 5.20 and Proposition 5.26], the group CH(XF) is the direct limit of the groups CH(XL) with L/k a finite subextension of F/k.\\nSuch an extension L/k is of degree prime to p because it is a purely inseparable extension of a field of characteristic ≠p.\\nUsing the fact that the functor A↦AZ⊂Q⊗Z/p commutes with any exact functor commuting with tensor products, we see that the natural map colimk⊂L⊂F[L:k]<∞(CH(XL)Z⊂Q⊗Z/p)→CH(XF)Z⊂Q⊗Z/p is an isomorphism.\\nThe lemma follows. □\\nRemark 8.5\\nProposition 8.3 actually gives some new information about Steenrod operations modulo p in characteristic not p.\\nDenote by μ:CH(-)⊗Z/p→CH(-)Z⊂Q⊗Z/p the natural quotient map.\\nLet X be a variety, and (12)K(X)=ker(CH(X)→grK0′(X)).\\nThen K(X) consists of torsion elements.\\nLet Kp(X) be its image in CH(X)⊗Z/p.\\nOne can ask the following question: \"What is the set E of operations Q on Chow groups modulo p such that μ∘Q vanishes on Kp(X), for all X?\"\\nBy construction, we have Ti(Kp(X))=0; hence a consequence of Proposition 8.3 is that Ti′∈E, for all i.\\nOn the other hand when p=2 and j>1, then the cohomological Steenrod square S2j-1 does not belong to E (see [16, Remark 8.4]).\\nThis can also be used to obtain information on grK0′(X).\\nFor example, a direct consequence of Proposition 8.3 is that gr2K0′(D) contains non-zero 3-torsion, where D is the variety of [27] (over a field of characteristic zero).\\nRemark 8.6\\nOne can use the operations Ti to recover some of the results of [15].\\nAssume that X is a variety and L/k an extension of the base field such that CH(XL) is torsion-free.\\nThen Ti is an endomorphism of CH(XL)⊗Z/p.\\nWe set S0=id, and define inductively, for n>0 and x∈CH(XL)⊗Z/p, Sn(x)=-∑i=1nTi∘Sn-i(x).\\nLet Ch¯(X)=im(CH(X)⊗Z/p→CH(XL)⊗Z/p) be the reduced Chow group modulo p.\\nSince the operations Ti commute with extension of the base field, they send the subgroup Ch¯(X)⊂CH(XL)⊗Z/p to itself.\\nTherefore, the association x↦Sn(x) induces an operation of this subgroup, the n-th reduced Steenrod operation.\\nPart 3.\\nDegree formula and applications.\\nWe now describe some consequences of the results obtained above.\\nIn order to make unconditional statements, we restrict ourselves to applications of the fact that p-integrality holds in codimension ≤p(p-1)-1 (Theorem 3.2).\\nWe fix prime number p.\\nWhen X is a projective variety, we let nX be the positive generator of the image of the degree map CH(X)→Z.\\nWe also set nX(p)=pvp(nX).\\nLet x:X→Spec(k) be the structural morphism of X.\\nWe denote by χ(OX) the integer corresponding to x∗[OX] under the identification K0′(Spec(k))=Z.\\nIn other words, χ(OX)=∑j≥0(-1)jdimkHj(X,OX).\\nNote that ch[OSpec(k)]=[Spec(k)], so that χ(OX)=deg∘ch0[OX].\\nIndex and Euler characteristic\\nWe begin by giving a restriction on the possible values of the index nX of a projective variety X, in terms of two integers which do not change under field extensions: the dimension of X and the Euler characteristic χ(OX).\\nProposition 9.1\\nLet X be a projective variety of dimension <p(p-1) . Thenvp(nX)≤[dimXp-1]+vp(χ(OX)).\\nProof\\nWe have, by Theorem 3.2, vp(ch0[OX])≥-[dimXp-1], which means that there is an integral zero-cycle x∈CH0(X), and an integer λ prime to p such that x=λ⋅p[dimX/(p-1)]⋅ch0[OX].\\nTaking degrees, we obtain nX|λ⋅p[dimX/(p-1)]⋅χ(OX), whence the result. □\\nLet X be an integral projective variety of dimension i(p-1), with i>0.\\nWe define in Z/nX(p)tp(X)=pi-1⋅χ(OX)modnX(p).\\nThen Proposition 9.1 amounts to saying that we have, when i<p, p⋅tp(X)=0modnX(p).\\nThe same conclusion holds for any i>0 when X is a local complete intersection variety by Proposition 4.1, or if p-integrality holds in codimension ≤i(p-1).\\nRemark 9.2\\nBy [26, Corollary 1], the class tp(X) vanishes when the base field is perfect of characteristic p.\\nRemark 9.3\\nAssume that i<p.\\nLet up(X)∈CH0(X) be a cycle whose class modulo p and p-primary torsion is Ti[X].\\nThen its image up¯(X) in CH0(X)Z(p)⊂Q satisfies up¯(X)=pi⋅ch0[OX]modpCH0(X)Z(p)⊂Q.\\nHence degup¯(X)=pi⋅χ(OX)modpnXZ(p) and degup(X)p=pi-1⋅χ(OX)modnX(p).\\nThus the class tp(X) corresponds to the Rost numbers for a certain combination of Steenrod operations (see [22, p.\\n20]) under the map Z/nX→Z/nX(p).\\nWhen f:Y→X is a morphism between varieties of the same dimension, then the integer degf is defined as the degree of the extension of function fields when f is dominant, and as zero otherwise.\\nTheorem 9.4\\nDegree Formula\\nLet f:Y→X be a morphism of integral projective varieties of the same dimension i(p-1) with 0<i≤p . Thentp(Y)=degf⋅tp(X)modnX(p).\\nProof\\nWe have in K0′(X)(13)f∗[OY]=degf⋅[OX]+δ with δ∈K0′(X)(i(p-1)-1).\\nThis element δ can be written as a linear combination of elements of type [OZ], for Z a closed subvariety of X, with dimZ≤i(p-1)-1.\\nNote that nX(p)|nZ(p) for such Z.\\nThe result is obtained by projecting (13) to K0′(Spec(k)), and using Proposition 9.1.□\\nThus the class tp(-) is defined for varieties of dimension i(p-1) when i is arbitrary, satisfies the degree formula when i≤p, and is of p-torsion when i≤p-1.\\nRemark 9.5\\nLet X be a projective variety of dimension i(p-1), with i≤p.\\nAssume that there is a morphism f:X→Y, for some projective variety Y, such that f∗[X]∈K(Y) (see (12)).\\nThen tp(X)=0modnY(p).\\nCorrespondences modulo p\\nLet X and Y be varieties, with Y projective and X integral.\\nA correspondence α:X↝Y is an element α∈CH(X×Y).\\nThe multiplicity of α is the image of α under the composite CH(X×Y)→CH(Spec(k(X))×Y)⟶degCH(Spec(k(X)))=Z.\\nStrong p-incompressibility\\nLet p be a prime number.\\nFollowing [18, p.\\n150], we call an integral projective variety X strongly p-incompressible if the existence of a correspondence X↝Y of multiplicity prime to p, with Y an integral projective variety of dimension ≤dimX and such that vp(nY)≥vp(nX), implies that dimY=dimX, and that there exists a correspondence Y↝X of multiplicity prime to p.\\nProposition 10.1\\nLet p be a prime number, and i an integer such that 0<i≤p . Let X be an integral projective variety with vp(nX)≥i . Assume that χ(OX) is prime to p . Then dimX≥i(p-1) .\\nIn case of equality, X is strongly p-incompressible.\\nProof\\nAssume that dimX<i(p-1).\\nThen in particular dimX<p(p-1), and Proposition 9.1 gives i≤vp(nX)≤[dimXp-1]+vp(χ(OX))<i, a contradiction.\\nHence dimX≥i(p-1).\\nNow we assume that dimX=i(p-1).\\nWe proceed as in the proof of [22, Theorem 7.2] - but as we include the case i=p, we cannot use the relation p⋅tp(X)=0.\\nLet Y be an integral projective variety of dimension ≤dimX, with a correspondence X↝Y of multiplicity prime to p, and such that vp(nY)≥vp(nX).\\nWe can assume that there is an integral variety Z with dimZ=dimX, and two projective morphisms f:Z→X and g:Z→Y↪Y′, such that degf is prime to p.\\nHere Y′ is the product of Y with a projective space of appropriate dimension: in particular dimY′=dimX and nY′=nY.\\nSince by Theorem 9.4 we have degf⋅tp(X)=tp(Z)modnX(p), we see that tp(Z) is non-zero modulo nX(p), hence modulo nY(p).\\nNow by the same theorem we have degg⋅tp(Y′)=tp(Z)modnY(p), hence degg is non-zero and g is dominant, so that Y=Y′ and dimY=dimX.\\nThen Z gives a correspondence Y↝X of multiplicity prime to p.\\nFor further reference, let us mention that we also obtain that tp(Y) is non-zero modulo nY(p). □\\nLet X be the Severi-Brauer variety of a central division algebra of degree pn, with p a prime number.\\nThen X is strongly p-incompressible when the characteristic of the base field is not p[22, Example 7.2, Theorem 7.2].\\nAccording to [18, Example 2.3], it is unknown whether X is strongly p-incompressible when the characteristic is p.\\nWe can treat the case n=1 with Proposition 10.1.\\nCorollary 10.2\\nThe Severi-Brauer variety of a central division algebra of prime degree p is strongly p-incompressible.\\nIndex reduction formula\\nWe mentioned in [13, Section 4.1] that the index reduction formula of [31, Corollary (B)] can be generalized to base fields of arbitrary characteristic.\\nThe results obtained here allow us to additionally remove all assumptions of regularity.\\nProposition 10.3\\nLet X and Y be integral projective varieties, of dimensions ≤i(p-1) for some i≤p . Assume that vp(nY)≥vp(nX)≥i, p|χ(OY), and χ(OX) is prime to p . Then there is no correspondence X↝Y of multiplicity prime to p.\\nProof\\nThe first part of Proposition 10.1 implies that dimX=i(p-1); hence dimY≤dimX.\\nIf such a correspondence exist, the last sentence of the proof of Proposition 10.1 would imply that χ(OY) is prime to p, a contradiction. □\\nRost\\'s correspondences\\nThe operations Ti can be used to extend the case n=1 in [25, Theorem 9.1] to arbitrary fields.\\nTheorem 10.4\\nLet X be a smooth projective variety of dimension p-1 . Assume that X has a special correspondence in the sense of [25, Definition 5.1], with b=1 . Assume moreover that X has no zero-cycle of degree prime to p . Thendeg(r(p)(-TX)⋅[X])≠0modp2.By Remark 9.3, this means that the integer χ(OX) is prime to p.\\nProof\\nWe only sketch how [25, Proof of Theorem 9.1] can be adapted.\\nThis proof only involves cycles of dimension ≤2p-3; in particular, the only Steenrod operation used is the first one.\\nMoreover, since the degree map factors through the Chow group modulo torsion, there is no loss in using the operation with values in this group.\\nAll the properties needed are contained in Proposition 7.4. □\\nAcknowledgments\\nThe support of EPSRC Responsive Mode grant EP/G032556/1 is gratefully acknowledged.\\nI thank Alexander Vishik for his interest in this work, and for the useful suggestions that he made.\\nSchemes over a regular base\\nLet S be a regular connected scheme of finite Krull dimension.\\nThen, as explained in [9, Section 20.1], most results of [9] for varieties over fields extend to arbitrary schemes of finite type over S. There are only two difficulties :\\n- the lack of external product in general.\\n- one should use relative dimension dimS instead of the usual dimension.\\nIn particular, the homological Chern character can be constructed in this generality.\\nThe purpose of this appendix is to explain how Theorem 3.2 (and thus the construction of the operations Ti, i=0,…,p-1) can be extended to this setting.\\nLet VS be the category of schemes quasi-projective over S. Homological Adams operations are constructed in [28] for objects of VS.\\nThe results of Section 2 extend without difficulty to the category VS.\\nHowever, both proofs of Proposition 3.1 used the fact that X contains a non-empty open regular subscheme.\\nWe now give a proof that works for arbitrary objects of VS, using the notations introduced in the beginning of Section 2.\\nProposition A.1\\nLet l∈Z-{0}, X∈VS, and x∈K0′(X)(d) . Thenψl(x)-l-d⋅x∈K0′(X)(d-1)⊗Z[1/l].\\nProof\\nAs before, one can assume that X is integral and d=dimSX, and we have the exact sequence 0→K0′(X)(d-1)⊗Z[1/l]→K0′(X)(d)⊗Z[1/l]⟶u∗K0′(Spec(k(X)))⊗Z[1/l]→0.\\nChoose a closed embedding X↪W, with W connected and smooth over S. Let x be the generic point of X, and write Wx for Spec(OW,x).\\nThen the map u∗ in the sequence above may be identified with the map f∗:K0X(W)⊗Z[1/l]→K0{x}(Wx)⊗Z[1/l] and the composite u∗∘ψl corresponds to f∗∘(θl(-TW/S)⋅ψXl)=θl(-TW/S)⋅ψ{x}l∘f∗.\\nThe action of θl(-TW/S)∈K0(W) on K0{x}(Wx) factors through K0(Wx).\\nSince Wx is a local scheme, the rank map K0(Wx)→Z is an isomorphism.\\nThe rank of θl(-TW/S) is l-rankTW/S[16, (2), p.\\n6].\\nSince W is flat over S, we have dimSW=tr.deg.(k(W)/k(S))=rankTW/S.\\nThus θl(-TW/S) acts on K0{x}(Wx) by multiplication by l-dimSW.\\nBy [12, (A4\\') p.\\n263, see also Proof of Proposition 5.3], ψ{x}l is multiplication by lcodim(X,W).\\nThis gives, using [9, Lemma 20.1, (2)], u∗∘ψl=lcodim(X,W)-dimSW⋅u∗=l-dimSX⋅u∗.\\nWe can now conclude using the exact sequence above. □\\nAs a consequence, Theorem 3.2 immediately extends to the category VS.\\nFinally, let X be a scheme of finite type over S (possibly non quasi-projective).\\nProceeding as in the proof of [9, Lemma 18.3, (3)], we see that there is always an envelope X′→X over S, such that X′∈VS.\\nMoreover we see, using [9, Lemma 20.1, (3)], that K0′(X′)(d)→K0′(X)(d) is surjective, for any d.\\nUsing this remark, Theorem 3.2 is easily extended to the category of schemes of finite type over S.\\n\\n'"

In this section, we use the theorem of Gabber asserting that, over a field of characteristic different from p, any integral variety X admits a regular alteration of degree prime to p.  Using Gabber's theorem, we choose f:Z→X a projective morphism, with Z a regular connected variety of dimension d, and such that [k(Z):k(X)]=λ is prime to p.  Assume that X is a variety and L/k an extension of the base field such that CH(XL) is torsion-free.\n",

In this section we use the invariant ideals ID found in Section 3 to obtain commutative algebras of difference operators acting in the space of functions defined on the affine planes.  The operators T1,…,Tn-1 have the same form as the operators T1,…,Tn-1 of Section 3 in the case R=Cn, and the proof of invariance under their action follows by Proposition 3.5.  The formula (2.25) gives the explicit form of n Macdonald operators(4.18)M-br=∑I⊂{1,…,n+1}|I|=r∏i∈Ij∉Itexj-xi-t-1exj-xi-1∏i∈ITxiℏ,r=1,…,n, where |I| is the number of elements in the set I⊂{1,…,n+1}.  Following [7-9,20] we define DAHA for the Rˆ case, then we define the Cherednik-Dunkl operators as elements of DAHA acting in the polynomial representation and describe the Macdonald-Ruijsenaars systems in these terms.\n",
      "We consider the polynomial representation of Double Affine Hecke Algebras (DAHAs) and construct its submodules as ideals of functions vanishing on the special collections of affine planes.  This generalizes certain results of Kasatani in types An, (Cn∨,Cn).  We obtain commutative algebras of difference operators given by the action of invariant combinations of Cherednik-Dunkl operators in the corresponding quotient modules of the polynomial representation.  This gives known and new generalized Macdonald-Ruijsenaars systems.  Thus in the cases of DAHAs of types An and (Cn∨,Cn) we derive Chalykh-Sergeev-Veselov operators and a generalization of the Koornwinder operator respectively, together with complete sets of quantum integrals in the explicit form.\n",

      "Summary for Marine and terrestrial environmental changes in NW Europe preceding carbon release at the Paleocene-Eocene transition: The gradual lowering of surface water salinity and increase in the C/N ratio from 4m before the CIE onset at 22/10a-4 (above 2618m, Fig. 9), therefore, may also be the result of further uplift and restriction of the North Sea Basin, bringing the coastline and transported terrestrial material into closer proximity to the centrally-located 22/10a-4, although there is no documented sea level fall in the North Sea preceding the CIE (Knox, 1996; Powell et al., 1996).  Despite the limitations of this method, the large variation in the %low salinity dinoflagellate cysts (ranging from 0% to 80%) clearly indicates that significant environmental changes in surface water conditions occurred during the CIE onset in the central North Sea, and is supported by coeval changes in the sedimentary carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio (Fig. 10) which reflects changes in the proportion of terrestrial/marine organic material deposited in the North Sea Basin due to terrestrial runoff and productivity (see Section 4.4).  As there is no direct evidence for regional uplift causing further restriction of the North Sea Basin associated with the CIE onset, increased regional precipitation may have been the major cause of increased C/N ratios (elevated fluvial runoff) and dinoflagellate cyst changes (lower surface water salinity) at and following the CIE onset in 22/10a-4 (Fig. 9).  Since dinoflagellate cysts indicate increased halocline stratification of the North Sea at the CIE (Fig. 9d), and C/N ratios indicate a greater proportion of terrestrial carbon (Fig. 9c), it seems likely that the large reduction in I. hiatus in 22/10a-4 reflects a change in vegetation cover in the source region rather than simply a general reduction in the supply of pollen due to proximity of the coast.  The Paleocene-Eocene marker event Apectodinium augustum (Bujak and Brinkhuis, 1998) occurs in 22/10a-4 at 2617.35m (Fig. 3), approximately at the CIE onset (as was found at 30/14-1, Fig. 1, Sluijs et al., 2007).  In this study we focus on paleoenvironmental signals from a high resolution marine core collected from the central North Sea (Fig. 1), in order to understand changes to precipitation, ocean stratification, productivity and vegetation over the onset of the PETM.  Some of these samples (2619.60, 2614.73, and 2614.71m) also contain negative δ13CTOC, indicative of the CIE (Fig. 3).  Alternatively, an increase in regional precipitation could have caused elevated terrestrial runoff (C/N ratios, kaolinite) and lower surface water salinity above 2618m before the CIE onset (Fig. 9).  Whilst neotropical vegetation in Central America appears to have responded to warming during the PETM with increased diversity and origination rates (Jaramillo et al., 2010), central North America experienced a rapid migration of plant communities associated with lower precipitation at the onset of the CIE (Wing et al., 2005), and southern England may have experienced a major change in plant composition due to changes in local fire-regime (Collinson et al., 2009).  Palynological evidence from Arctic Spitsbergen (Harding et al., 2011) and New Zealand (Crouch et al., 2003a) suggests increased terrestrial runoff occurred at the onset of the CIE which may be related to hydrologic changes, and massive Pyrenees conglomerate deposits have been interpreted as the result of an abrupt increase in extreme precipitation within the early CIE (Schmitz and Pujalte, 2007).  Five samples from below the CIE at 2619.60, 2617.35, 2617.44, 2614.73, and 2614.71m (indicated in Fig. 5) contain Apectodinium, in contrast to the other samples below the CIE (Figs.  There is evidence for sea level rise at the onset of the CIE in southeast England (Powell et al., 1996) and in Spitsbergen (Harding et al., 2011), although any uplift associated with the proximal NAIP could have caused local sea level fall near the Faeroe-Shetland platform.  C/N values broadly follow %low salinity dinoflagellate cysts (Fig. 9), with an increase at the Lista/Sele Formation boundary, 4m before the onset of the CIE and within the early CIE.  Evidence for the linkage of the North Sea, Kilda and Arctic Basins comes from the coincident onset of A. augustum and laminated sediments at the CIE onset in sections from the North Sea (this study), Spitsbergen (Harding et al., 2011), and Lomonosov Ridge (Sluijs et al., 2006).  A change to a dominance of angiosperm over gymnosperm pollen at the CIE onset has previously been recorded in the Arctic (Sluijs et al., 2006) and Wyoming (Smith et al., 2007).\n",
      "Environmental changes associated with the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM, ∼56Ma) have not yet been documented in detail from the North Sea Basin.  Located within proximity to the North Atlantic igneous province (NAIP), the Kilda Basin, and the northern rain belt (paleolatitude 54°N) during the PETM, this is a critical region for testing proposed triggers of atmospheric carbon release that may have caused the global negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) in marine and terrestrial environments.  The CIE onset is identified from organic matter δ13C in exceptional detail within a highly expanded sedimentary sequence.  Pollen and spore assemblages analysed in the same samples for the first time allow a reconstruction of possible changes to vegetation on the surrounding landmass.  Multiproxy palynological, geochemical, and sedimentologic records demonstrate enhanced halocline stratification and terrigenous deposition well before (103yrs) the CIE, interpreted as due to either tectonic uplift possibly from a nearby magmatic intrusion, or increased precipitation and fluvial runoff possibly from an enhanced hydrologic cycle.  Stratification and terrigenous deposition increased further at the onset and within the earliest CIE which, coupled with evidence for sea level rise, may be interpreted as resulting from an increase in precipitation over NW Europe consistent with an enhanced hydrologic cycle in response to global warming during the PETM.  Palynological evidence indicates a flora dominated by pollen from coastal swamp conifers before the CIE was abruptly replaced with a more diverse assemblage of generalist species including pollen similar to modern alder, fern, and fungal spores.  This may have resulted from flooding of coastal areas due to relative sea level rise, and/or ecologic changes forced by climate.  A shift towards more diverse angiosperm and pteridophyte vegetation within the early CIE, including pollen similar to modern hickory, documents a long term change to regional vegetation.  ► We identify the carbon isotope excursion from the North Sea in exceptional detail.  ► We document changes to ocean stratification well before atmospheric carbon release.  ► Precursor stratification may be associated with the trigger for carbon release.  ► Increased precipitation and runoff likely occurred along with carbon release.  ► We document a rapid change to regional vegetation during carbon release.\n",

      "Summary for Opening the gateways for diatoms primes Earth for Antarctic glaciation: Diatom δ30Si is a proxy for diatom silicic acid utilisation (Fig. 2a) because frustule growth preferentially incorporates 28Si over 30Si with 30ε∼-1.1‰ (De La Rocha et al., 1997).  Firstly, the rising silicic acid concentration in intermediate waters through the late Eocene, as indicated by sponge δ30Si decline (Fig. 6b), suggests the supply of silicic acid to the Southern Ocean surface is most likely to have increased across the period of diatom δ30Si rise.  Without Southern Ocean upwelling, or exchange between the Pacific and Atlantic basins, overturning circulation would have been sluggish (Cramer et al., 2009) trapping silicic acid and other nutrients in the deep ocean, limiting surface primary productivity and hence organic carbon burial via the biological pump.  Our new records of diatom and sponge δ30Si are shown in Fig. 6c and b (respectively) alongside benthic δ18O stacks for the main ocean basins (Fig. 6a) in which the 1-1.5‰ positive excursion centred around ∼33.7Ma marks the onset of Antarctic glaciation (data from Cramer et al., 2009).  Sponge δ30Si constitutes a proxy for bottom-water silicic acid concentration and ocean circulation (Fig. 2b) which can be used as a constraint on the concentration of silicic acid supplied to the surface ocean, facilitating resolution of the effects upon diatom δ30Si of diatom uptake and silicic acid supply.  Although diatom production is not always linked to carbon export in the modern ocean, a strong coupling between production and export is observed in regions where nutrient supply is continuous, strong seasonal blooms occur and a diatom flora particularly efficient at carbon export exists, such as at Southern Ocean sites such near the Antarctic Polar Front (Buesseler et al., 2001).  These upwelled waters are advected northwards by Ekman transport and thus provide nutrients that fuel diatom (as well as other phytoplankton) production, creating marked bands of opal and carbon export (Fig. 1; Speer et al., 2000; Ito et al., 2005).  Diatoms originated in the Jurassic, and open ocean diatom diversity and abundance increased through the late Cretaceous and Palaeogene, pumping silicic acid to depth and driving a concomitant decrease in shelf chert abundance (Maliva et al., 1989).  Such conditions of upwelling and high nutrient availability would have favoured diatom proliferation and opal export; high diatom nutrient uptake and growth rates, along with their large storage vacuole, provide a competitive advantage over other phytoplankton when nutrient input to the surface is high and episodic (Falkowski et al.,1998; Rabosky and Sorhannus, 2009; Tozzi et al., 2004).  Diatom production is characterised by high, rapid particle flux out of near surface waters, a process which enhances labile carbon concentration and organic carbon remineralisation in the deep ocean (Henson et al., 2012).  Together, the diatom and sponge δ30Si records provide the first biogeochemical footprint of major late Eocene diatom expansion and proliferation to near modern levels by the Oi1 event in the Southern Ocean.  Site 1090 is situated between the Sub-Antarctic and Sub-Tropical fronts (Gersonde et al., 1999) such that it underlies silicic acid depleted surface waters resulting from extensive diatom production along the northern pathway (Fig. 1 and 3b).  Silicic acid utilisation is determined by both diatom uptake (broadly reflecting diatom productivity) and silicic acid supply to the surface ocean.  Recent work has shown the 2-20μm fraction is generally most representative of diatom δ30Si (Egan et al., 2012).  Diatom carbon fixation and silicification, which may be decoupled by changes in iron fertilisation or the relative silicifcation of the ambient species (Ragueneau et al., 2000), are suggested to have remained coupled through this time period based on the broad coincidence between increased diatom production (δ30Si, Southern Ocean opal burial), increased organic carbon burial, and positively trending δ13C (Anderson and Delaney, 2005; Diester-Haass, 1995; Salamy and Zachos, 1999).\n",
      "The abrupt onset of Antarctic glaciation during the Eocene-Oligocene Transition (∼33.7Ma, Oi1) is linked to declining atmospheric pCO2 levels, yet the mechanisms that forced pCO2 decline remain elusive.  Biogenic silicon cycling is inextricably linked to both long and short term carbon cycling through the diatoms, siliceous walled autotrophs which today account for up to 40% of primary production.  It is hypothesised that during the Late Eocene a sharp rise in diatom abundance could have contributed to pCO2 drawdown and global cooling by increasing the proportion of organic carbon buried in marine sediment.  Diatom and sponge silicon isotope ratios (δ30Si) are here combined for the first time to reconstruct the late Eocene-early Oligocene ocean silicon cycle and provide new insight into the role of diatom productivity in Antarctic glaciation.  At ODP site 1090 in the Southern Ocean, a 0.6‰ rise in diatom δ30Si through the late Eocene documents increasing diatom silicic acid utilisation with high, near modern values attained by the earliest Oligocene.  A concomitant 1.5‰ decline in sponge δ30Si at ODP site 689 on the Maud Rise tracks an approximate doubling of intermediate depth silicic acid concentration in the high southern latitudes.  Intermediate depth silicic acid concentration peaked at ∼31.5Ma, coincident with the final establishment of a deepwater pathway through the Tasman Gateway and Drake Passage.  These results suggest that upwelling intensification related to the spin-up of a circum-Antarctic current may have driven late Eocene diatom proliferation.  Organic carbon burial associated with higher diatom abundance and export provides a mechanism that can account for pCO2 drawdown not only at, but also prior to, Antarctic glaciation as required by a pCO2 'threshold' mechanism for ice sheet growth.  Diatom and sponge δ30Si used to reconstruct the Eocene-Oligocene silicon cycle.  0.6‰ late Eocene rise in diatom δ30Si (increasing silicic acid utilisation).  1.5‰ late Eocene/early Oligocene sponge δ30Si fall (increasing silicic acid concentration).  Upwelling related to proto-ACC facilitated late Eocene diatom proliferation.  Diatom driven carbon burial contributed to pCO2 decline before Antarctic glaciation.\n",

      "Summary for Marine 187Os/188Os isotope stratigraphy reveals the interaction of volcanism and ocean circulation during Oceanic Anoxic Event 2: The Osi data also show that a major pulse of volcanism interpreted to be associated with activity from Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs), i.e., Caribbean and High Arctic (Fig. 1; Snow et al., 2005; Tegner et al., 2011) occurred at or just prior to the onset of OAE 2.  During the emplacement of the LIP we assume that growth of the plateau does not continue to affect the Os isotope composition (Robinson et al., 2009), since the Osi values are homogeneous (∼0.2; Fig. 3).  The onset of OAE 2 is identified by an abrupt 2-3‰ VPDB δ13Corg positive shift from values of ∼-27‰ in the upper Hartland Shale, 4.3 m below the CTB (Fig. 2; Supplementary Material, Table 1a; Sageman et al., 2006).  The Osi values in this study were determined from Re-Os data and the 187Re decay constant (1.666e-11a-1; Smoliar et al., 1996; Supplementary Material, Table 2a-f) using the CTB age of 93.90 Ma that was determined from astrochronologic interpolation between volcanic ash ages (based on both 40Ar/39Ar and 206Pb/238U determinations; Gradstein et al., 2012; Meyers et al., 2012a).  Based on the trend to unradiogenic Osi values at Site 1260, Vocontian Basin, Furlo and Site 530 we suggest that the initiation of volcanism was at least ∼200 kyr prior to 'A' (∼94.58 Ma; Fig. 3, CLIP i), with the major pulse of submarine volcanism happening at ∼-30 kyr (94.41 Ma; Fig. 3, CLIP ii), where all locations possess near mantle-like Osi values.  Based on the GSSP time scale, and confirmed by additional estimates from different OAE 2 sites, the duration of the C isotope excursion that characterizes the OAE 2 is between 500-600 kyr (Meyers et al., 2012b).  The Osi stratigraphic profiles across the CTB in this study are from (Fig. 1): the Portland #1 core, which is representative of the Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) near Pueblo, Colorado (Western Interior Seaway (WIS); Kennedy et al., 2000); the Wunstorf core in Germany, a representative section in the NW European pelagic shelf sea (Voigt et al., 2008); the Vocontian Basin, south east France (Western Tethys; Grosheny et al., 2006; Jarvis et al., 2011); and DSDP Site 530 (proto-South Atlantic; Forster et al., 2008).  Across the onset of OAE 2 there is a dramatic shift to very high values in Os isotope concentration.  At Portland the Osi values show some distinct fluctuations prior to the onset of OAE 2 (point 'A' on the δ13Corg curve).  In contrast to the elevated radiogenic Osi values just before 'A' at Portland, the Osi values of Site 1260, Vocontian Basin, Furlo and Site 530 show a progressive trend to unradiogenic Osi values (0.75 to 0.55) over ∼155 kyr (Fig. 3) suggesting that hydrothermal input dominated Os chemistry in the open oceans.  From 'A' through to the lower Turonian, the Osi profiles and values are very similar across Portland, Furlo, Site 530 and Wunstorf, progressively trending from unradiogenic (∼0.2) to radiogenic values (∼0.6 to 0.7; Fig. 3) within ∼350 kyr.  Furthermore, our interpretation of the Osi profile concurs with the hypothesis of increased ocean circulation based on analysis of neodymium (Nd) isotopes (Martin et al., 2012; Zheng et al., 2013).  This hypothesis is supported by the observed radiogenic Osi values for >500 kyr prior to 'A' at Portland and elsewhere (Fig. 3).\n",
      "High-resolution osmium (Os) isotope stratigraphy across the Cenomanian-Turonian Boundary Interval from 6 sections for four transcontinental settings has produced a record of seawater chemistry that demonstrates regional variability as a function of terrestrial and hydrothermal inputs, revealing the impact of palaeoenvironmental processes.  In every section the 187Os/188Os profiles show a comparable trend; radiogenic values in the lead up to Oceanic Anoxic Event 2 (OAE 2); an abrupt unradiogenic trend at the onset of OAE 2; an unradiogenic interval during the first part of OAE 2; and a return to radiogenic values towards the end of the event, above the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary.  The unradiogenic trend in 187Os/188Os is synchronous in all sections.  Previous work suggests that activity of the Caribbean LIP (Large Igneous Province) was the source of unradiogenic Os across the OAE 2 and possibly an instigator of anoxia in the oceans.  Here we assess this hypothesis and consider the influence of activity from other LIPs; such as the High Arctic LIP.  A brief shift to high radiogenic 187Os/188Os values occurred in the Western Interior Seaway before the onset of OAE 2.  We evaluate this trend and suggest that a combination of factors collectively played critical roles in the initiation of OAE 2; differential input of nutrients from continental and volcanogenic sources, coupled with efficient palaeocirculation of the global ocean and epeiric seas, enhanced productivity due to higher nutrient availability, which permitted penecontemporaneous transport of continental and LIP-derived nutrients to trans-equatorial basins.  Use Osi isotope stratigraphy to infer driving mechanism(s) of Oceanic Anoxic Event 2.  Osi profiles from 6 sites illustrate the regional variability of seawater chemistry.  δ13Corg and Osi records combined generate an integrated timescale model based on the GSSP.  Anoxia is a function of feedback based on climate change and volcanism.  Quantitatively constrain the duration of volcanism from Caribbean LIP.\n",

      "Summary for Minor and trace element emissions from post-combustion CO2 capture from coal: Experimental and equilibrium calculations: The mass balances however show that compared to the concentration of elements in the sorbent, the concentrations partitioning to the gaseous phase is very low.  The literature suggests that limestone can be used to capture Ni, Pb and Cd, thus accounting for the increased concentration of these three elements with increasing bed inventory [30].  Therefore, they are considered to be of low volatility, but the increase of these elements in the flue gas analysis suggests that they are being removed from the sorbent under the high temperature conditions in the fluidised bed.  Further, it was noted that non-volatile elements have been found more likely to condense out with particulate matter, resulting in an increase in trace element concentration with a decrease in sorbent size [3,29].  Fig. 6 shows the concentrations of minor elements in the solid sorbent, where increasing bed inventory resulted in increasing values observed for Co, Ni, Cu, Mo, Cd, and Sn.  A mass balance showing effects of increasing SO2 concentration on elemental partitioning for the carbonator is provided as Table 4, calculated based on the incoming and outgoing concentrations of elements.  Overall, although concentrations in the flue gas are small at <2ppm, increasing bed inventory does appear to increase the concentration of the majority of major elements present in the flue gas.  Fig. 12 shows that increasing SO2 concentration does influence trace element sorbent concentration, and for B in particular, concentrations rose from 2ppm to 2.6ppm for 0 and 1000ppm SO2 respectively.  The results show that looping cycle tests carried out in the presence of increasing concentrations of SO2 resulted in, for the most part, a decrease in elemental concentrations in both solid sorbent and flue gas samples.  However, all elements included within Fig. 5 can be considered to be at very low concentrations of <2ppm.\n",

Thermodynamic equilibrium modelling undertaken to support experimental work.  Elemental partitioning, including gaseous elemental emissions from pilot scale (25kWth), post combustion CO2 capture using a Ca-based sorbent, have been investigated for naturally occurring elemental impurities found in limestone, that have the potential to be released to the environment under carbonation and calcination conditions.  Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis of Longcliffe SP52 limestone was undertaken to identify other impurities present, and the effect of sorbent mass and SO2 concentration on elemental partitioning in the carbonator between solid sorbent and gaseous phase was investigated, using a bubbler sampling system.  Samples were analysed using ICP-MS, which showed that sorbent mass and SO2 concentration in the carbonator effected the concentrations of gaseous trace elements sampled.  Thermodynamic modelling of the carbonation and calcination process was also undertaken, based on molar quantities of trace elements identified from ICP-MS analysis of limestone, which provided useful information with regards to element stability and partitioning under realistic CO2 capture conditions.\n",

      "Summary for The Cassini Enceladus encounters 2005-2010 in the view of energetic electron measurements: The electron measurements obtained by the MIMI/LEMMS in the energy range between 15keV and several MeV onboard Cassini showed that the drift and bounce motion of the electrons perpendicular and along the B→×∇B→lines cause drop-out signatures in the distribution of electrons by the moon itself and by any material in the environment around the moon.  If the energy of the measured electrons is lower than the resonant energy for a given orbital distance from the planet an absorption feature should be observed only downstream of the moon as described above while the bite-out in the high-energy channels should only be observed upstream of the moon.  Fig. 3 shows the trajectory of Cassini during the flybys E0, E12, and E13 close to the moon inside of 10 Enceladus radii REnc.  An overview of the electron measurements from the MIMI/LEMMS instrument in the vicinity of Enceladus for the flybys E0, E12, and E13 is shown in Fig. 2.  At the orbit of Enceladus the resonance energy is at about 1MeV for 90° equatorial pitch angle and about 1.3MeV for electrons with 30° pitch angle (Roussos et al., 2007) assuming full corotation at the distance of the moon.  The interaction between energetic electrons and the moon essentially is given by the individual motion of the particles.  The responses of energetic electrons inside the MIMI/LEMMS instrument during the equatorial south flybys are summarized in Fig. 5.  Energetic electrons observed by the MIMI/LEMMS sensor bounce along the field lines and drift perpendicular to B→×∇B→, which, away from Enceladus, is along Enceladus' orbit.  The energetic electron intensities measured during the high-latitude flybys at Enceladus are summarized in Fig. 8.  The 14 flybys of Cassini at the moon Enceladus shed new light on the interaction of material released from the moon and the magnetosphere.  Therefore any absorption signature related to the moon upstream is caused by high-energy electrons.  As mentioned above the region in the vicinity of a moon where electrons are absorbed (upstream or downstream) depends on their energy.  Both equatorial flybys E7 and E8 (observing at approximately 90deg around closest approach) reveal \"ramps\" in the lowest energy channels of MIMI/LEMMS, on both sides of Enceladus.  Vice versa downstream of the moon: only electrons with energies less than the resonance energy can be absorbed.  Drop-out signatures in all the selected channels indicate that the bite-out is caused by high-energy electrons lost at the moon drifting upstream.  In yellow the high-energy interaction region measured in channels BE, E4, and G1 is marked again, as for the north equatorial flybys.\n",
      "► Ramp-like features in electron intensities in the low-energy channels.  ► High-energy depletions upstream for electrons with energies above the resonant energy.  ► \"Dust\"-related peaks in the electron data correlated with data from other instrument onboard Cassini.  The moon Enceladus, embedded in Saturn's radiation belts, is the main internal source of neutral and charged particles in the Kronian magnetosphere.  A plume of water ice molecules and dust released through geysers on the south polar region provides enough material to feed the E-ring and also the neutral torus of Saturn and the entire magnetosphere.  In the time period 2005-2010 the Cassini spacecraft flew close by the moon 14 times, sometimes as low as 25km above the surface and directly through the plume.  For the very first time measurements of plasma and energetic particles inside the plume and its immediate vicinity could be obtained.  In this work we summarize the results of energetic electron measurements in the energy range 27keV to 21MeV taken by the Low Energy Magnetospheric Measurement System (LEMMS), part of the Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument (MIMI) onboard Cassini in the vicinity of the moon in combination with measurements of the magnetometer instrument MAG and the Electron Spectrometer ELS of the plasma instrument CAPS onboard the spacecraft.  Features in the data can be interpreted as that the spacecraft was connected to the plume material along field lines well before entering the high density region of the plume.  Sharp absorption signatures as the result of losses of energetic electrons bouncing along those field lines, through the emitted gas and dust clouds, clearly depend on flyby geometry as well as on measured pitch angle/look direction of the instrument.  We found that the depletion signatures during some of the flybys show \"ramp-like\" features where only a partial depletion has been observed further away from the moon followed by nearly full absorption of electrons closer in.  We interpret this as partially/fully connected to the flux tube connecting the moon with Cassini.  During at least two of the flybys (with some evidence of one additional encounter) MIMI/LEMMS data are consistent with the presence of dust in energetic electron data when Cassini flew directly through the south polar plume.  In addition we found gradients in the magnetic field components which are frequently found to be associated with changes in the MIMI/LEMMS particles intensities.  This indicates that complex electron drifts in the vicinity of Enceladus could form forbidden regions for electrons which may appear as intensity drop-outs.\n",

      "Summary for Episodic bright and dark spots on Uranus: The main feature visible in the 25 December image is a small dark spot accompanied by a bright companion cloud.  In the 25 December image, we again found a small dark spot and a bright eastward companion cloud close to the predicted location of BS2, but this time the companion feature is quite bright in the FQ889N image, indicating cloud particles had at this time reached pressures significantly lower (i.e. at altitudes significantly higher) than the methane condensation level.  On 26 October 2011, Gemini images of Uranus revealed another unusually bright cloud feature (Fig. 2C), providing us with another possible opportunity to study this episodic development.  BS1 began to decline in brightness between October 26 and November 10, and was not clearly identifiable after 16 December, though subtle features were found that are consistent with survival through our last image on 29 December 2011, in which BS1 appears just north of a faint dark spot visible in F845M images, and has much more contrast in the F889N image taken on that date.  These images (Fig. 2A and B) revealed that the cloud feature had brightened and impelled us to further investigation.  In the 20 and 29 December images BS2 is found adjacent to a faint dark spot, which is plausibly a marker for the putative vortex circulation that might be producing the bright cloud features.  From Fig. 12 it can be inferred that this feature would also have been visible in K′ images, had any been taken at the time.  When first identified in the 26 October 2011 Gemini-North image (Fig. 4F), the bright spot (BS1) appeared as a relatively compact feature with two adjacent components.  BS2 was identifiable in 20 and 29 December TOO images, and in the 25 December image the feature seen may be either BS2 or the result of merging of BS1 and BS2.  A similar reversal in relative brightness is seen in the pair of H and Hcont images from 27 July (Fig. 14).  We did not become aware of the second bright spot (BS2) until we saw the 10 November image (Fig. 4P).  The uncertainties in establishing a position value are relatively low for each individual image, but the position of the suspected underlying circulation feature that generates the cloud features is far less certain, and probably better estimated from the variability in latitude values from different images and longitude deviations from a constant drift rate model.  Companion clouds related to this dark spot were also seen in H images obtained with the Keck II telescope NIRC2 Narrow Angle (NA) camera (Fig. 1C), though they were not unusually bright in these images.  The dark spot is visible in F845M and F775W images and the companion cloud is visible in these images and also with greater contrast in FQ889N and FQ906N images, implying that the bright cloud is elevated well above the methane condensation level.  This second spot was tracked from 27 July until at least 20 December, although with larger time gaps because it was not found in the October HST images.\n",
      "► A spot of high and increasing brightness was discovered on Uranus on 26 October 2011.  ► This 24°N spot was found about 500 mb above the 1.2bar methane condensation level.  ► A second and 500mb deeper brightspot was discovered just 2°N of the first.  ► Their different drift rates measured from July to Dec led to many close approaches.  ► Hubble imaging revealed a rare dark spot near their 25 December 2011 close approach.  The northern mid-latitudes of Uranus produce greater episodes of bright cloud formation than any other region on the planet.  Near 30°N, very bright cloud features were observed in 1999, 2004, and 2005, with lifetimes of the order of months.  In October 2011, Gemini and HST observations revealed another unusually bright cloud feature near 23°N, which was subsequently identified in July 2011 observations and found to be increasing in brightness.  Observations obtained at Keck in November 2011 revealed a second bright spot only 2°N of the first, but with a substantially different drift rate (-9.2°E/day vs -1.4°E/day), which we later determined would lead to a close approach on 25 December 2011.  A Hubble Target of Opportunity proposal was activated to image the results of the interaction.  We found that the original bright spot had faded dramatically before the HST observations had begun and the second bright spot was found to be a companion of a new dark spot on Uranus, only the second ever observed.  Both spots exhibited variable drift rates during the nearly 5months of tracking, and both varied in brightness, with BS1 reaching its observed peak on 26 October 2011, and BS2 on 11 November 2011.  Altitude measurements based on near-IR imaging in H and Hcont filters showed that the deeper BS2 clouds were located near the methane condensation level (≈1.2bars), while BS1 was generally ∼500mb above that level (at lower pressures).  Large morphological changes in the bright cloud features suggest that they are companion clouds of possibly orographic nature associated with vortex circulations, perhaps similar to companion clouds associated with the Great Dark Spot on Neptune, but in this case at a much smaller size scale, spanning only a few degrees of longitude at their greatest extents.\n",

      "Summary for Energetic electron observations of Rhea's magnetospheric interaction: The width of Rhea's wake tends to increase with increasing electron energy.  The presence of an exosphere can therefore not explain the observations of ambient plasma density levels in Rhea's wake.  R3 is the only flyby so far where electron densities show dropout signatures across both wake boundaries.  Khurana et al. (2008) calls these features \"expansion fans\", which at Rhea extend up to several moon radii on either side of the wake.  Field gradients tend to exclude particles from the wake at electron energies that magnetic drifts start to become important.  These dropouts are near the wake flanks, although in some cases (R3) they can be observed also than 5RRh far from Rhea.  The first close downstream flyby on November 26, 2005 (termed R1), revealed broad energetic electron (20-100keV) flux dropouts extending almost 7-8 Rhea radii (RRh) on each side of Rhea's wake.  The corotational wake is again evident as a region with a large dropout in electron fluxes.  In none of these flybys, however, do the plasma density measurements show the anticipated dropout at the wake.  Data from most Rhea flybys show that the electron number density profiles extracted from RPWS fUH observations do not show an absorption signature during the wake or flux tube crossings.  We also stress that the energetic electron wake has a significantly different structure to that of a cold plasma wake.  Data from the lowest energy proton channels of LEMMS (A0, A1 - 25-56keV range) show flux enhancements in the vicinity of Rhea's wake (Fig. 11) that could be consistent with large negative electrostatic potentials (tens of keV) that accelerate ions along the magnetic field direction.  The electron density in RPWS also shows a broad and gradual dropout centered around the expected time of the wake crossing.  Simulations indicate that Rhea's cold plasma wake should refill completely within a distance of about 10RRh downstream (Simon et al., 2012; Roussos et al., 2008).  The magnetic field magnitude (bottom panel) ∣B∣ shows the expected, persistent enhancement within the wake boundaries (Simon et al., 2012).  The signature of the wake crossing is a large dropout in particle fluxes of between one and four orders of magnitude, depending on electron energy.  As in R1, the wake becomes broader with increasing electron energy.  The cold electron density from RPWS does not show a wake signature, although densities are much more variable within the wake boundaries compared to R1.  From the overview of the four flyby observations given in Section 4, we can understand that Rhea's interaction region has many complex features in the energetic particle, plasma density and the magnetic field datasets.  From the above it is clear that critical for the formation of this instability are the strength of gradients in the various plasma and field parameters in Rhea's wake.  Closer to the wake, small scale dropouts are more symmetric in most channels and resemble what was observed in R1.  In various plots of this study we will indicate the wake boundaries only for electrons with E<Erk, since most of the available data are in this energy regime (Section 3).  Here, the geometrical/corotational wake is defined on the basis of where energetic electron absorption may be observed.\n",
      "► We give a detailed review of an energetic electron dataset in a lunar-type interaction.  ► A local transport process occurs in the wake of Rhea.  ► The transport is associated to a flute type of instability driven by pressure gradients.  ► We show that surface charging is an important element of the interaction.  Saturn's moon Rhea is thought to be a simple plasma absorber, however, energetic particle observations in its vicinity show a variety of unexpected and complex interaction features that do not conform with our current understanding about plasma absorbing interactions.  Energetic electron data are especially interesting, as they contain a series of broad and narrow flux depletions on either side of the moon's wake.  The association of these dropouts with absorption by dust and boulders orbiting within Rhea's Hill sphere was suggested but subsequently not confirmed, so in this study we review data from all four Cassini flybys of Rhea to date seeking evidence for alternative processes operating within the moon's interaction region.  We focus on energetic electron observations, which we put in context with magnetometer, cold plasma density and energetic ion data.  All flybys have unique features, but here we only focus on several structures that are consistently observed.  The most interesting common feature is that of narrow dropouts in energetic electron fluxes, visible near the wake flanks.  These are typically seen together with narrow flux enhancements inside the wake.  A phase-space-density analysis for these structures from the first Rhea flyby (R1) shows that Liouville's theorem holds, suggesting that they may be forming due to rapid transport of energetic electrons from the magnetosphere to the wake, through narrow channels.  A series of possibilities are considered to explain this transport process.  We examined whether complex energetic electron drifts in the interaction region of a plasma absorbing moon (modeled through a hybrid simulation code) may allow such a transport.  With the exception of several features (e.g. broadening of the central wake with increasing electron energy), most of the commonly observed interaction signatures in energetic electrons (including the narrow structures) were not reproduced.  Additional dynamical processes, not simulated by the hybrid code, should be considered in order to explain the data.  For the small scale features, the possibility that a flute (interchange) instability acts on the electrons is discussed.  This instability is probably driven by strong gradients in the plasma pressure and the magnetic field magnitude: magnetometer observations show clearly signatures consistent with the (expected) plasma pressure loss due to ion absorption at Rhea.  Another potential driver of the instability could have been gradients in the cold plasma density, which are, however, surprisingly absent from most crossings of Rhea's plasma wake.  The lack of a density depletion in Rhea's wake suggests the presence of a local cold plasma source region.  Hybrid plasma simulations show that this source cannot be the ionized component of Rhea's weak exosphere.  It is probably related to accelerated photoelectrons from the moon's negatively charged surface, indicating that surface charging may play a very important role in shaping Rhea's magnetospheric interaction region.\n",

      "Summary for Magnetosphere-atmosphere coupling at Saturn: 1 - Response of thermosphere and ionosphere to steady state polar forcing: Using a radial profile of magnetospheric plasma velocities inferred from Voyager plasma observations and assuming fixed ionospheric conductances of 1mho, Cowley et al. (2004) calculated the associated field aligned currents and resulting ionospheric Joule heating rates of around 2.5TW per hemisphere, considerably larger than energy from the direct precipitation of electrons (globally ⩽0.06TW) and solar EUV heating (globally 0.15-0.27TW) (Müller-Wodarg et al., 2006).  Diurnally-averaged temperatures at the peak ionospheric density level (10-5mbar) and latitude 78° from simulations R1-R18 (Table 1) are shown in the upper panel of Fig. 12 as a function of 10keV electron energy flux and peak electric field strength.  Moore et al. (2006) presented a comparison of calculated ionospheric densities with low latitude Cassini RSS observations (Nagy et al., 2006) and concluded that the observed dawn-dusk asymmetry in the ionosphere at low latitudes was best reproduced by the model when imposing an external influx of neutral water molecules into the low- to mid-latitude upper atmosphere at a rate of (0.5-1.0)×107cm-2s-1.  The bottom panel of Fig. 12 shows as a function of 10keV electron energy flux and peak electric field strength the column emission rates of H3+ calculated from the vertical profiles of H3+ densities and temperatures of simulations R1-R18.  While we include direct solar EUV heating in our calculations, it has a negligible influence on the energy balance of Saturn's thermosphere, as shown earlier by Müller-Wodarg et al. (2006).  In simulating the response of Saturn's coupled thermosphere-ionosphere system to magnetospheric forcing, we varied two key parameters in the model, namely, the energy flux of precipitating auroral 10keV electrons and the auroral electric field strength.  This is related to Saturn's fast rotation rate and the sub-corotation of the auroral thermosphere, which ultimately generates a meridional wind transporting energy from equator to pole in the deep atmosphere, thus cooling down the equatorial regions (Smith et al., 2007).  High latitude temperatures in Saturn's upper atmosphere published until recently had values below ∼460K (Melin et al., 2007; Vervack and Moses, 2012), but Melin et al. (2011) and Stallard et al. (2012) have shown that H3+ emission may be brighter than previously indicated, and temperatures hotter.  According to the simulations of our study magnetospheric energy cannot explain the observed thermospheric temperatures at low and mid latitudes.  (11)) is added to the neutral gas energy equation of Müller-Wodarg et al. (2006).  Using a global model of Saturn's coupled thermosphere and ionosphere (Moore et al., 2004, 2010; Müller-Wodarg et al., 2006; Galand et al., 2009, 2011), we self-consistently calculate for the first time the response of the coupled thermosphere-ionosphere system to a range of values for energetic particle precipitation flux and high latitude electric fields.  Fig. 5 shows the peak electron densities in Saturn's ionosphere as a function of latitude.  At auroral latitudes the main peak in ion production is due to particle ionisation from incident electrons (Galand et al., 2011).\n",
      "► We self-consistently calculate Saturn magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere coupling.  ► Magnetospheric energy controls flow of mass and energy in Saturn's thermosphere.  ► Thermospheric dynamics are key to understanding high latitude energy balance.  ► H3+ observations combined with our simulations may constrain H2 (v⩾4) abundances.  We present comprehensive calculations of the steady state response of Saturn's coupled thermosphere-ionosphere to forcing by solar radiation, magnetospheric energetic electron precipitation and high latitude electric fields caused by sub-corotation of magnetospheric plasma.  Significant additions to the physical processes calculated in our Saturn Thermosphere Ionosphere General Circulation Model (STIM-GCM) include the comprehensive and self-consistent treatment of neutral-ion dynamical coupling and the use of self-consistently calculated rates of plasma production from incident energetic electrons.  Our simulations successfully reproduce the observed high latitude temperatures as well as the latitudinal variations of ionospheric peak electron densities that have been observed by the Cassini Radio Science Subsystem experiment (RSS).  We find magnetospheric energy deposition to strongly control the flow of mass and energy in the high and mid-latitude thermosphere and thermospheric dynamics to play a crucial role in driving this flow, highlighting the importance of including dynamics in any high latitude energy balance studies on Saturn and other Gas Giants.  By relating observed H3+ column emissions and temperatures to the same quantities inferred from simulated atmosphere profiles we identify a potential method of better constraining the still unknown abundance of vibrationally excited H2 which strongly affects the H3+ densities.  Our calculations also suggest that local time variability in H3+ column emission flux may be largely driven by local time changes of H3+ densities rather than temperatures.  By exploring the parameter space of possible high latitude electric field strengths and incident energetic electron fluxes, we determine the response of thermospheric polar temperatures to a range of these magnetospheric forcing parameters, illustrating that 10keV electron fluxes of 0.1-1.2mWm-2 in combination with electric field strengths of 80-100mVm-1 produce H3+ emissions consistent with observations.  Our calculations highlight the importance of considering thermospheric temperatures as one of the constraints when examining the state of Saturn's magnetosphere and its coupling to the upper atmosphere.\n",

      "Summary for The escape of heavy atoms from the ionosphere of HD209458b.: This value agrees with the observations to within 1σ (Vidal-Madjar et al., 2004; Ben-Jaffel and Hosseini, 2010), but it is smaller than the transit depth of 6.6% predicted by the M7 model.  Their model line profiles were also constrained by the high resolution STIS E140M observations of Vidal-Madjar et al. (2003) that resolve the components, although this data has low S/N and it was not used for transit observations.  In order to calculate predicted transits in the C II and Si III lines, we created model emission line profiles for HD209458 based on SUMER observations of the Sun (Curdt et al., 2001) adjusted to the observations of HD209458 (Linsky et al., 2010).  In this section we constrain the temperature and composition of the upper atmosphere of HD209458b through a combined analysis of transit observations in the FUV emission lines.  We note that the transit in the Si III line was not detected earlier by Vidal-Madjar et al. (2004).  We also used results from a state-of-the-art photochemical model (Lavvas et al., in preparation) to constrain the density profiles of the observed species in the lower atmosphere.  The observations indicate that the transit depths based on the C2 model fall short of the observed values because the model underestimates the width of the absorption lines.  These observations were followed by Moutou et al. (2003) who attempted to measure the transit depth in the He 1083nm line that was predicted to be significant by Seager and Sasselov (2000).  However, Ben-Jaffel and Hosseini (2010) fitted the H Lyman α observations by scaling the density profiles from the model of Garcia Munoz (2007), and argued that suprathermal O and C+ are required to fit the transit depths in the O I and C II lines.  In fact, Koskinen et al. (2010) (hereafter K10) also showed that absorption by thermal H and O in such a thermosphere explains both the H Lyman α and O I 1304Å transit depths.  Further, their model related the observations to a few physically motivated characteristics such as the mean temperature and composition of the upper atmosphere.  We then varied the total flux within the line profile until the results agreed with the observations of Linsky et al. (2010).  Indeed, the predicted transit depth agrees with the observations to better than 1σ if the O/H ratio is enhanced by a factor of 5 relative to solar (see the MSOL2 model in Table 2).  Based on the observed transits in the Na D lines, Charbonneau et al. (2002) argued that Na is depleted in the atmosphere because their cloudless solar composition model predicted significantly deeper absorption in the D lines.  This is clear because at least a solar abundance of silicon in the thermosphere is required to explain the large transit depth in the Si III line.  We note that the temperature in the lower thermosphere near the 1μbar region has been constrained previously by Vidal-Madjar et al. (2011a,b) who used the Na D lines to constrain the density and temperature profiles in the atmosphere of HD209458b.  Fig. 5 shows the line-integrated transit depth within the H Lyman α line profile as a function of the cutoff level for the C2 model.  We have shown that a substantial abundance of silicon in the upper atmosphere is required to produce a detectable transit in the Si III line.  They fitted both the line-integrated transit depth based on the low resolution G140L data (Vidal-Madjar et al., 2004; Ben-Jaffel and Hosseini, 2010), and the transit depths and light curve based on the medium resolution G140M data (Vidal-Madjar et al., 2003; Ben-Jaffel, 2007, 2008) (see Figs.\n",
      "► We compare UV transits of HD209458b with empirical and hydrodynamic models.  ► We constrain the mean temperature, densities and escape rates of different species.  ► The detection of atomic oxygen implies a minimum mass loss rate of 6×106kgs-1.  ► The results constrain the temperature, chemistry, and ionization of the atmosphere.  ► Detection of Si2+ indicates that clouds of forsterite and enstatite do not form.  Transits in the H I 1216Å (Lyman α), O I 1334Å, C II 1335Å, and Si III 1206.5Å lines constrain the properties of the upper atmosphere of HD209458b.  In addition to probing the temperature and density profiles in the thermosphere, they have implications for the properties of the lower atmosphere.  Fits to the observations with a simple empirical model and a direct comparison with a more complex hydrodynamic model constrain the mean temperature and ionization state of the atmosphere, and imply that the optical depth of the extended thermosphere of the planet in the atomic resonance lines is significant.  In particular, it is sufficient to explain the observed transit depths in the H I 1216Å line.  The detection of O at high altitudes implies that the minimum mass loss rate from the planet is approximately 6×106kgs-1.  The mass loss rate based on our hydrodynamic model is higher than this and implies that diffusive separation is prevented for neutral species with a mass lower than about 130amu by the escape of H.  Heavy ions are transported to the upper atmosphere by Coulomb collisions with H+ and their presence does not provide as strong constraints on the mass loss rate as the detection of heavy neutral atoms.  Models of the upper atmosphere with solar composition and heating based on the average solar X-ray and EUV flux agree broadly with the observations but tend to underestimate the transit depths in the O I, C II, and Si III lines.  This suggests that the temperature and/or elemental abundances in the thermosphere may be higher than expected from such models.  Observations of the escaping atmosphere can potentially be used to constrain the strength of the planetary magnetic field.  We find that a magnetic moment of m≲0.04mJ, where mJ is the jovian magnetic moment, allows the ions to escape globally rather than only along open field lines.  The detection of Si2+ in the thermosphere indicates that clouds of forsterite and enstatite do not form in the lower atmosphere.  This has implications for the temperature and dynamics of the atmosphere that also affect the interpretation of transit and secondary eclipse observations in the visible and infrared wavelengths.\n",

      "Summary for The escape of heavy atoms from the ionosphere of HD209458b.: We used our model to calculate temperature and velocity profiles based on different heating efficiencies and stellar fluxes.  Koskinen et al. (2010a) inferred a mean temperature of 8250K in the thermosphere of HD209458b with p0=1μbar (the M7 model).  The model also showed that stellar heating leads to temperatures of ∼10,000K in the upper atmosphere, and predicted an energy-limited mass loss rate of 4.7×107kgs-1 (Yelle, 2006).  The mass loss rate based on the substellar atmosphere for this model is 2.8×107kgs-1, in good agreement with the Murray-Clay et al. (2009) results.  In order to test the effect of higher temperatures in the lower thermosphere, we extended the MC09 model to p0=1μbar (with T0=1300K) and again used the full solar spectrum for heating and ionization.  All of these models are based on the outflow boundary conditions for temperature, velocity, and density.  This criteria is consistent with the equations of motion, and it means that r0 that should be used to calculate X0 is above the upper boundary of our model because significant stellar heating persists at all altitudes.  This explains the large range of temperature and density profiles predicted by earlier models that arise from different boundary conditions and assumptions about the stellar flux, radiative transfer, and heating efficiencies.  We calculated the temperature differences for H, H+, and electrons based on the C2 model.  The sonic point in the C1 model is below 11Rp, and it is in a region where stellar heating is significant.  We highlight the effect of heating efficiency and stellar flux on the density and temperature profiles, and constrain the likely heating rates by using photoelectron heating efficiencies based on the results of Cecchi-Pestellini et al. (2009) and our own estimates (Section 3.1).  As the heating efficiency increases from 0.1 (in models with the average solar flux), the high altitude temperature increases and the sonic point moves to lower altitudes, reaching down to 4Rp with a net heating efficiency of 1.  For instance, the lower boundary conditions are constrained by results from a detailed photochemical model of the lower atmosphere (Lavvas et al., in preparation).  These results disagree with Yelle (2004) and Murray-Clay et al. (2009) who predicted a lower transition altitude, but they agree qualitatively with the solar composition model of Garcia Munoz (2007).  These studies often include an efficiency factor in the mass loss rate that is based on the heating efficiency of the upper atmosphere (e.g., Lammer et al., 2009).  Model C2 is otherwise similar to C1 but the heating efficiency varies with photoelectron energy and altitude (see below).  We have constructed a new model for the upper atmosphere of HD209458b in order to explain the detections of H, O, C+, and Si2+ at high altitudes around the planet (Vidal-Madjar et al., 2003, 2004; Linsky et al., 2010).  We discuss the general dependency of the temperature and velocity profiles on the net heating efficiency and stellar flux, and relate this discussion to new temperature and velocity profiles for HD209458b that are based on realistic photoelectron heating efficiencies calculated specifically for close-in EGPs.\n",
      "► We developed a new model to explain the FUV transit observations of HD209458b.  ► We find a qualitative agreement between the model and the observed atmosphere.  ► We constrain the mass loss rate and escape mechanism based on stellar heating.  ► We present density profiles for the detected heavy atoms and ions.  ► Diffusive separation of heavy species is prevented by the escape of H and protons.  The detections of atomic hydrogen, heavy atoms and ions surrounding the extrasolar giant planet (EGP) HD209458b constrain the composition, temperature and density profiles in its upper atmosphere.  Thus the observations provide guidance for models that have so far predicted a range of possible conditions.  We present the first hydrodynamic escape model for the upper atmosphere that includes all of the detected species in order to explain their presence at high altitudes, and to further constrain the temperature and velocity profiles.  This model calculates the stellar heating rates based on recent estimates of photoelectron heating efficiencies, and includes the photochemistry of heavy atoms and ions in addition to hydrogen and helium.  The composition at the lower boundary of the escape model is constrained by a full photochemical model of the lower atmosphere.  We confirm that molecules dissociate near the 1μbar level, and find that complex molecular chemistry does not need to be included above this level.  We also confirm that diffusive separation of the detected species does not occur because the heavy atoms and ions collide frequently with the rapidly escaping H and H+.  This means that the abundance of the heavy atoms and ions in the thermosphere simply depends on the elemental abundances and ionization rates.  We show that, as expected, H and O remain mostly neutral up to at least 3Rp, whereas both C and Si are mostly ionized at significantly lower altitudes.  We also explore the temperature and velocity profiles, and find that the outflow speed and the temperature gradients depend strongly on the assumed heating efficiencies.  Our models predict an upper limit of 8000K for the mean (pressure averaged) temperature below 3Rp, with a typical value of 7000K based on the average solar XUV flux at 0.047AU.  We use these temperature limits and the observations to evaluate the role of stellar energy in heating the upper atmosphere.\n",

      "Summary for The formation of sulfate, nitrate and perchlorate salts in the martian atmosphere: We used a 1-dimensional photochemical model to calculate the atmospheric production and deposition rate of sulfate, nitrate and perchlorate salts in the Amazonian martian atmosphere.  First we added bromine chemistry (see Appendix A) to the model of Catling et al. (2010) for the terrestrial atmosphere.  Using purely gas-phase pathways, Catling et al. (2010) reproduced measured profiles of chlorine species in the terrestrial atmosphere and estimated deposition rates of both perchlorate and nitrate that were consistent with Atacama soil measurements.  As part of model development, we matched the calculated mixing ratios of H2O, CO, H2O2, and O2 to those in the modern martian atmosphere (following Zahnle et al., 2008) and then added chlorine and sulfur chemistry from Catling et al. (2010), as discussed in Section 3.1.  In the absence of rain, perchloric acid accumulates on the surface through dry deposition, where it reacts with minerals to form perchlorate salts (Catling et al., 2010).  Following the model of Zahnle et al. (2008), atmospheric transport, temperature, and relative humidity are initialized as follows.  We apply a parameterization of the evolution of the solar flux (from Claire et al., 2012) to the nominal model to quantify changes in deposition fluxes over time.  The model has recently been modified to study chlorine, sulfur, and nitrogen chemistry in the modern terrestrial atmosphere (Catling et al., 2010) and hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen chemistry in the modern martian atmosphere (Zahnle et al., 2008).  We next calculated the perchlorate, sulfate, and nitrate deposition fluxes on Mars as a function of volcanic input.  On Earth, one source of sulfate, nitrate, and perchlorate salts is atmospheric deposition.  The sulfate deposition flux produced in the nominal model is compatible with estimates of the amount of sulfates on Mars.  Before we added bromine chemistry to the nominal Mars model, we added the chemistry to the terrestrial model of Catling et al. (2010).  This study builds upon the work of Catling et al. (2010), which used a one-dimensional photochemical model to investigate the formation of salts in the terrestrial atmosphere over the Atacama Desert.  Increasing the surface pressure from 6.3mb to 35mb decreases the deposition rate of atmospheric perchlorate from 4.6×10-3 to 7×10-5moleculescm-2s-1.  Changing the chemical composition of the atmosphere affects the perchlorate production and deposition rate.\n",
      "We model a modified martian atmosphere to calculate deposition fluxes of salts.  Estimated sulfate soil concentrations are consistent with observed sulfate on Mars.  Pernitric acid forms more rapidly in the martian atmosphere than nitric acid.  An atmospheric origin for perchlorate is precluded (or supplemented by other processes).  In extremely arid regions on Earth, such as the Atacama Desert, nitrate, sulfate and perchlorate salts form in the atmosphere and accumulate on the surface from dry deposition according to diagnostic evidence in their oxygen isotopes.  Salts of similar oxyanions should have formed in the atmosphere of Mars because of comparable photochemical reactions.  We use a 1-D photochemical model to calculate the deposition rates of sulfate, nitrogen oxyanions, and perchlorate from Mars' atmosphere, given a plausible range of volcanic fluxes of sulfur- and chlorine-containing gases in the past.  To calculate integrated fluxes over time, we assume that throughout the last 3byr (the Amazonian eon), the typical background atmosphere would have been similar to today's cold and dry environment.  If the soil has been mixed by impact perturbations to a characteristic depth of ∼2m during this time, given a time-average volcanic flux 0.1% of the modern terrestrial volcanic flux, the model suggests that the soil would have accumulated 1.0-1.7wt.% SO42- and 0.2-0.4wt.% N in the form of pernitrate (peroxynitrate) or nitrate.  The calculated sulfate concentration is consistent with in situ observations of soils from rovers and landers and orbital gamma ray spectroscopy.  However, nitrates or pernitrates are yet to be detected.  The modeled formation of perchlorate via purely gas-phase oxidation of volcanically-derived chlorine is insufficient by orders of magnitude to explain 0.4-0.6wt.% ClO4- measured by NASA's Phoenix Lander.  The far smaller amount of ozone in the martian atmosphere compared to the terrestrial atmosphere and the colder, drier conditions are the cause of lower rates of gas phase oxidation of chlorine volatiles to perchloric acid.  Our calculations imply that non-gas-phase processes not included in the photochemical model, such as heterogeneous reactions, are likely important for the formation of perchlorate and are yet to be identified.\n",

      "Summary for Sets of lengths in maximal orders in central simple algebras: (d) ⇒ (a) is trivial, and (a) ⇒ (d) follows because T is a Dedekind prime ring, and hence every fractional left T-ideal (in the ring-theoretic sense) is invertible (see [42, §5.2.14] or [47, §22, §23] for the more specific case where R is a maximal order in a CSA), and therefore divisorial.  The next proposition shows that for divisorial fractional left or right H-ideals with H maximal, already both, Ol(I) and Or(I), are maximal.  If H is a maximal order, then the notions of a left H-ideal and that of an integral fractional left H-ideal coincide (this will follow from Lemma 5.6.1 and Lemma 5.6.2).  For all H′∈α and all g∈CM there exists a maximal divisorial left H′-ideal with [η(I)]=g.  If H is an order in Q and I is a fractional left H-ideal, then Ol(I) and Or(I) are orders.\n",
      "Let O be a holomorphy ring in a global field K, and R a classical maximal O-order in a central simple algebra over K.  We study sets of lengths of factorizations of cancellative elements of R into atoms (irreducibles).  In a large majority of cases there exists a transfer homomorphism to a monoid of zero-sum sequences over a ray class group of O, which implies that all the structural finiteness results for sets of lengths-valid for commutative Krull monoids with finite class group-hold also true for R.  If O is the ring of algebraic integers of a number field K, we prove that in the remaining cases no such transfer homomorphism can exist and that several invariants dealing with sets of lengths are infinite.\n",

      "Summary for In situ investigations of Fe3+ induced complexation of adsorbed Mefp-1 protein film on iron substrate: Fig. 8 shows the in situ ATR-FTIR spectra of the oxidized iron surface with pre-adsorbed Mefp-1 film obtained after exposure to the 10μM FeCl3 solution for different times.  In the Mefp-1 solution, complexes are mostly formed near the substrate since the Fe3+ released from the surface is immediately trapped by the catechols in the adsorbed protein film.  When the oxidized iron surface was exposed to the Mefp-1 solution, there is no visible Mefp-1 band on the CRM spectrum after 1min exposure (Fig. 10a).  The topograpical images of the Mefp-1 layer adsorbed on the iron surface in the buffer solution and in the FeCl3 solution are shown in Fig. 4b and c, respectively.  Interestingly, if the oxidized iron surface is kept immersed in the Mefp-1 solution, the Raman spectrum is gradually transformed into that obtained when the surface is exposed to the FeCl3 solution, and already after an hour's exposure, the two spectra are basically indistinguishable (Fig. 10c).  This confirms our hypothesis derived from the IR measurements that Fe3+ is slowly released from the oxidized iron surface in presence of a Mefp-1 solution, and this results in the formation of Fe(Cat)3-type complexes, similar to those observed when the pre-adsorbed Mefp-1 film is exposed to the diluted FeCl3 solution.  However, the bands are relatively broad, characteristic peaks of the Mefp-1 were not distinguishable, which is mainly due to the concentration of the protein solution being low (0.1mg/ml), so the amount of Mefp-1 adsorbed on the oxidized iron surface was not sufficient to be detected clearly by the CRM.  In situ CRM measurements were performed using an iron substrate in the Mefp-1 solution and also using such surfaces with a pre-adsorbed Mefp-1 film in the FeCl3 solution.  The spectroscopic results from the in situ measurements strongly suggest the formation of tri-Fe3+/DOPA complexes in the protein film during the exposure to both the Mefp-1 solution and the FeCl3 solution.  Through a pre-conditioning to produce a stable oxidized iron surface, we have studied the film formation of Mefp-1 on the iron substrate and Fe3+ enhanced complexation of the pre-adsorbed film, by using in situ techniques including QCM-D, Peak Force tapping AFM, ATR-FTIR, and CRM combined with DFT calculations.  The property images in Fig. 5 and mean values in Table 2 show that the Fe3+ enhanced complexation of the adsorbed Mefp-1 film results in less deformation, a slightly lower adhesion force between the tip and the adsorbed protein film, and a lower energy dissipation as the tip is tapping over the surface.  In situ Peak Force tapping mode AFM measurements were performed on iron QCM crystals (coated with iron) with a pre-adsorbed Mefp-1 film, immersed in buffer solution and FeCl3 solution, respectively.  During the exposure to the 10μM FeCl3 solution, Δf becomes less negative with time (Fig. 3b), which indicates that complexation between DOPA groups in Mefp-1 and Fe3+ causes significant removal of water from the adsorbed protein layer.  In conclusion, our analysis strongly indicates that Fe(Cat)3 complexes are formed in the adsorbed Mefp-1 film due to the release of Fe3+ from the oxidized iron surface.\n",
      "Pure iron was used as substrate for study of mussel adhesive protein adsorption.  Multianalytical in situ studies of the protein film forming and complexation.  Spectroscopy analysis was assisted by ab initial computational modeling.  Details of the film formation, structure, property, and compaction mechanism.  Tri-catechol/Fe3+ complexation leads to compaction of the surface protein film.  A range of in situ analytical techniques and theoretical calculations were applied to gain insights into the formation and properties of the Mefp-1 film on iron substrate, as well as the protein complexation with Fe3+ ions.  Adsorption kinetics of Mefp-1 and the complexation were investigated using QCM-D.  The results suggest an initially fast adsorption, with the molecules oriented preferentially parallel to the surface, followed by a structural change within the film leading to molecules extending toward solution.  Exposure to a diluted FeCl3 solution results in enhanced complexation within the adsorbed protein film, leading to water removal and film compaction.  In situ Peak Force Tapping AFM was employed for determining morphology and nano-mechanical properties of the surface layer.  The results, in agreement with the QCM-D observations, demonstrate that addition of Fe3+ induces a transition from an extended and soft protein layer to a denser and stiffer one.  Further, in situ ATR-FTIR and Confocal Raman Micro-spectroscopy (CRM) techniques were utilized to monitor compositional/structural changes in the surface layer due to addition of Fe3+ ions.  The spectroscopic analyses assisted by DFT calculations provide evidence for formation of tri-Fe3+/catechol complexes in the surface film, which is enhanced by Fe3+ addition.\n",

      "Summary for Rigorously modeling self-stabilizing fault-tolerant circuits: An ultra-robust clocking scheme for systems-on-chip: Rather, we allow for some stabilization time during which the module can \"clean up\" its internal state.  Formally, let P be a predicate on the input ports of node i's state transition module.  Fig. 20 shows stabilization by the resynchronization algorithm in a 4-node system: Eventually, all nodes switch to state none.  Hence, at the time when a node switches to ready, the delayed state information on the channels will not show non-faulty nodes in state propose any more.  The timer is reset to 0 when the node's state switches to s and will expire after T time has passed according to clock C, unless it is reset again beforehand.  Then Eout∈ΦThr(EI) iff for all t∈R, o(t)=1 if at least k input ports are in state 1 at time t, and o(t)=0 otherwise.  An execution of ports P on interval I⊆R assigns a state to each port in P at any time in I.  In order to exercise also complex test scenarios in a reproducible way, a dedicated testbed execution state machine (TESM), driven by the global clock, is used to control the times and nodes when and where clock speeds, transmission delays, and communicated fault states are changed and when a single node is reset throughout an execution of the system.  Now assume that each node runs a copy of this state machine, and at least n-f non-faulty nodes enter state increase during some time window [t,t+2d).  We define P holds at time t by structural induction: If P is equal to p=s, where p is an input port of node i's state transition module and s is one of the states signal p can obtain, then P holds at time t iff p(t)=s.  Point (4) is achieved by just forcing a node to reset to its initial state for this run at any time during the current execution.\n",
      "We present the first implementation of a distributed clock generation scheme for Systems-on-Chip that recovers from an unbounded number of arbitrary transient faults despite a large number of arbitrary permanent faults.  We devise self-stabilizing hardware building blocks and a hybrid synchronous/asynchronous state machine enabling metastability-free transitions of the algorithm's states.  We provide a comprehensive modeling approach that permits to prove, given correctness of the constructed low-level building blocks, the high-level properties of the synchronization algorithm (which have been established in a more abstract model).  We believe this approach to be of interest in its own right, since this is the first technique permitting to mathematically verify, at manageable complexity, high-level properties of a fault-prone system in terms of its very basic components.  We evaluate a prototype implementation, which has been designed in VHDL, using the Petrify tool in conjunction with some extensions, and synthesized for an Altera Cyclone FPGA.  We introduce a novel modeling framework for fault-tolerant VLSI circuits.  We cast a self-stabilizing clocking scheme from a companion article in this model.  We discuss the implications of theory and model for the resulting implementation.  We present the measures taken to avoid metastable upsets despite faults.

      "Summary for A note on weakly hyperbolic equations with analytic principal part: Using again the fact that Δ(t,ξ) is analytic in t and homogeneous of order 0 in ξ one can prove that there exist constants c1>0 and c2>0 independent of ξ such thatc1Δ(t,ξ)Z2(t,ξ)⩽Δ˜(t,ξ)⩽c2Δ(t,ξ)Z2(t,ξ), for all t∈(δ,T+δ) and ξ≠0.

      "Summary for Integral-valued polynomials over sets of algebraic integers of bounded degree: As IntQ(An) is the integral closure of the ring Int(Mn(Z)), in the same way, for every number field K, IntQ(OK) (which by (1) is an overring of IntQ(An)) is equal to the integral closure of a certain overring of Int(Mn(Z)), namely, the ring of integer-valued polynomials over the set MnK(Z) of matrices with characteristic polynomial equal to a minimal polynomial of some algebraic integer of maximal degree of K.  We may now represent the rings of integer-valued polynomials over a set of matrices MnP(Z), P a subset of Pnirr, as an intersection of the pullback rings Rα, where α ranges through the set of roots of the polynomials in P. Indeed, for such a subset P, by Corollary 3.1 and (5) we have:Int(MnP(Z),Mn(Z))=⋂α∈A(P)Rα=RA(P) where A(P)⊆An is the set of roots of all the polynomials p(X) in P (notice that by assumption all these algebraic integers have degree equal to n).  We remark that, as already mentioned in [8], this representation of Int(Mn(Z)) as an intersection of the rings Rα for α∈An, shows that Int(Mn(Z)) is not Prüfer, since there are many overrings Rα which are not integrally closed: by Proposition 3.1 it is sufficient to consider an algebraic integer α of degree n such that Z[α]⊊OQ(α); then the corresponding Rα is such an overring.  The next theorem shows that, given any subset A of algebraic integers of degree bounded by n, the integral closure of RA is SA, so, by Proposition 3.1, we can say that the integral closure of the intersection of the rings Rα, α in A, is equal to the intersection of their integral closures Sα.  Given an algebraic integer α of degree m⩽n, it is easy to see that the following equality holds:Sα=IntQ({α},An)≑{f∈Q[X]|f(α)∈An}.\n",

A similar property holds if we consider the set of all algebraic integers of degree n and a polynomial f∈Q[X]: if f(α) is integral over Z for every algebraic integer α of degree n, then f(β) is integral over Z for every algebraic integer β of degree smaller than n.  This second result is established by proving that the integral closure of the ring of polynomials in Q[X] which are integer-valued over the set of matrices Mn(Z) is equal to the ring of integral-valued polynomials over the set of algebraic integers of degree equal to n.\n",

      "Summary for The prevalence of tinnitus and the relationship with neuroticism in a middle-aged UK population: The UK Biobank assessment protocol did not include any tinnitus scale, nor did it measure the loudness of the tinnitus, however the subjective questions included have been deemed reliable in similar studies [2].  Two self-report questions on tinnitus were included in the touchscreen questionnaire, answered by 172,621 participants.  Analysing data from a large population of UK adults, we have shown that the prevalence of tinnitus increases with age, and that a high proportion of sufferers report tinnitus as being moderately or severely bothersome, although age was not related to the perceived severity of tinnitus.  After controlling for age, sex, hearing difficulty and deprivation, this study found that neuroticism was associated with tinnitus and bothersome tinnitus.  With regard to whether participants found their tinnitus to be bothersome, differences in neuroticism appeared to have a much stronger effect than any other factor.  The objectives of this study were to provide a detailed description of the prevalence of tinnitus in a large population study of UK adults aged 40 to 69years, according to age and sex, (following on from a previous study [5]), as well as to examine the link between tinnitus severity and neuroticism.  As neuroticism is a stable personality trait [28] it is unlikely to develop as a result of experiencing tinnitus.  This study reports the prevalence of tinnitus in a large population sample, while further exploring the link between tinnitus severity and neuroticism (previously only examined in clinical studies).  Furthermore, of those who have tinnitus, neuroticism has a stronger effect on the perceived severity than hearing difficulty.  A subsequent, conditional binary logistic multiple regression analysis was performed based on all participants with current tinnitus, with severity (tinnitus not bothersome as the reference category) as the dependent variable.  Further analyses were performed using binary logistic regression to examine whether neuroticism is associated with tinnitus and tinnitus severity, while controlling for demographic factors (age, sex, deprivation) and hearing difficulty.  Initially a binary logistic multiple regression analysis was performed with current tinnitus as the dependent variable ('no tinnitus' as the reference category) with all participants being at risk.  The present study reports data related to tinnitus and personality.\n",
      "Previous research has suggested that a substantial proportion of the population are severely affected by tinnitus, however recent population data are lacking.  Furthermore, there is growing evidence that the perception of severity is closely related to personality factors such as neuroticism.  In a subset (N=172,621) of a large population sample of >500,000 adults aged 40 to 69years, (from the UK Biobank dataset) we calculated the prevalence of tinnitus and that which is perceived as bothersome, and examined the association between tinnitus and a putative predisposing personality factor, neuroticism.  Participants were recruited through National Health Service registers and aimed to be inclusive and as representative of the UK population as possible.  The assessment included subjective questions concerning hearing and tinnitus.  Neuroticism was self-rated on 13 questions from the Eysenck Personality Inventory.  Associations between neuroticism and tinnitus were tested with logistic regression analyses.  Prevalence of tinnitus was significantly higher for males, and increased with age, doubling between the youngest and oldest age groups (males 13% and 26%; females 9% and 19% respectively).  Of those with tinnitus, females were more likely to report bothersome tinnitus.  Neuroticism was associated with current tinnitus and bothersome tinnitus, with the items: 'loneliness', 'mood swings', 'worrier/anxious' and 'miserableness', as the strongest associations of bothersome tinnitus.  Neuroticism was identified as a novel association with tinnitus.  Individuals with tinnitus and higher levels of neuroticism are more likely to experience bothersome tinnitus, possibly as a reflection of greater sensitivity to intrusive experiences.\n",

      "Summary for Structural studies of magnesium nitride fluorides by powder neutron diffraction: Bond valence calculations performed using the structure refined from PND data and the same rij and b parameters used for Mg3NF3 above [28], gave sums of 1.90 for Mg, 2.85 for N and 0.92 for F.  The first examples of these were magnesium nitride fluorides prepared by Andersson [4,5] and three phases were reported which had structures related to the rocksalt structure of MgO.  Rietveld refinement using both the PXD and ToF PND data was performed using the General Structure Analysis System (GSAS) through the windows based EXPGUI interface [26,27].  The refinement progressed smoothly and gave a good fit to the data using the L-Mg2NF structure as a starting model.  Recently Ba2NF was reported to form also with a layered anti-α-NaFeO2 structure from powder neutron diffraction measurements [17].  (Further PXD and PND refinement results and a table of anisotropic thermal displacement parameters can be found in the Supplementary information.)  Powder neutron diffraction studies have confirmed structures in which the fluoride and nitride anions are completely ordered in both cases.

      "Summary for Chemical weathering and provenance evolution of Holocene-Recent sediments from the Western Indus Shelf, Northern Arabian Sea inferred from physical and mineralogical properties: Temporal variations in magnetic susceptibility, mass accumulation rates, clay mineralogy, redness, illite crystallinity (FHWM) and hematite/goethite ratios are plotted against the Qunf Cave climate record of Fleitmann et al. (2003) (Fig. 13).  The variations in clay mineralogy at both core sites are consistent with previously published data for the Arabian Sea (Sirocko and Lange, 1991) and Indus Fan (Kolla et al., 1981) in that smectite and illite are the dominant mineral groups.  In general however, the smectite/(chlorite+illite) ratios of the Indus sediments show higher values (more weathering) between 10 and 5ka, when the monsoon was stronger.  We further test the ability of clay minerals to act as weathering proxies by comparing them with K/Al, which is the weathering proxy that is least affected by grain size or carbonate content, at least on the Indus Shelf (Limmer et al., 2012) (Fig. 12).  Because L* values have been shown to be affected by not only carbonate composition but also clay mineralogy (Balsam et al., 1999), we do not consider this to be suitable for this study.  εNd values indicate that some of the sediment deposited in the Early Holocene at Indus-10 was sourced from the Makran region, presumably through longshore drift, as well as from the Indus River mouth (Limmer et al., 2012).  We further compare the temporal evolution in neodymium isotope values with the variation in clay mineralogy in the two cores considered here, as well as from the river mouth (Alizai et al., 2012) (Fig. 11).  The shift towards less negative εNd values in Indus-10 at ~3ka is probably linked to reworking of older shelf sediments (Limmer et al., 2012).  In order to assess whether clay mineralogy relates to provenance in this setting we compared the smectite/(chlorite+illite), smectite/kaolinite and kaolinite/illite with the neodymium isotope characteristics of the sediments because this isotope system is widely accepted as a reliable provenance proxy that is not affected significantly by chemical weathering (Goldstein et al., 1984) (Fig. 10).\n",
      "We present a multi-proxy mineral record based on X-ray diffraction and diffuse reflectance spectrophotometry analysis for two cores from the western Indus Shelf in order to reconstruct changing weathering intensities, sediment transport, and provenance variations since 13ka.  Core Indus-10 is located northwest of the Indus Canyon and exhibits fluctuations in smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratios that correlate with monsoon intensity.  Higher smectite/(illite+chlorite) and lower illite crystallinity, normally associated with stronger weathering, peaked during the Early-Mid Holocene, the period of maximum summer monsoon.  Hematite/goethite and magnetic susceptibility do not show clear co-variation, although they both increase at Indus-10 after 10ka, as the monsoon weakened.  At Indus-23, located on a clinoform just west of the canyon, hematite/goethite increased during a period of monsoon strengthening from 10 to 8ka, consistent with increased seasonality and/or reworking of sediment deposited prior to or during the glacial maximum.  After 2ka terrigenous sediment accumulation rates in both cores increased together with redness and hematite/goethite, which we attribute to widespread cultivation of the floodplain triggering reworking, especially after 200years ago.  Over Holocene timescales sediment composition and mineralogy in two localities on the high-energy shelf were controlled by varying degrees of reworking, as well as climatically modulated chemical weathering.  ► We examine a high resolution multi-proxy physical properties from two marine cores.\n",

      "Summary for Soil structural responses to alterations in soil microbiota induced by the dilution method and mycorrhizal fungal inoculation: Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on data using soil dilution (10-1 and 10-6), planting regime (defined as either bare soil, planted non-mycorrhizal or planted mycorrhizal) and harvest time (month) as factors.  The dilution effects on soil OM were absent from the planted soils in the current experiment, although the AMF treatments had significantly less soil OM than either of the other planting regimes (bare soil and NM planted), possibly because of reduced root mass and species richness in addition to C losses to the AM fungi.  Furthermore across all months, bacterial TRF richness was positively correlated with aggregate stability in the bare soil and the NM planted treatments.  The only significant biological term to explain aggregate stability in the bare soil was bacterial TRF richness (P=0.019).  AM fungal colonisation resulted in increased aggregate stability relative to NM planted and bare soil treatments as would be expected and this was most noticeable in soils amended with the 10-1 dilution and also in months 3 and 5.  PCA analysis separated out the bacterial communities associated with the mycorrhizal plants and the bare soil amended with the 10-6 soil dilution (Fig. 3a).  Therefore mycorrhizal colonisation resulted in soil with reduced bacterial richness overall compared to equivalent NM soil.  In contrast to the other planting regimes (NM and bare soil) bacterial TRF richness was negatively correlated with aggregate stability in the mycorrhizal soils.  Bacterial TRF richness and microbial biomass-C were both greater in the NM planted soils than in the mycorrhizal or bare soils, with bare soil having the lowest biomass-C (data pooled across months).  The minimal difference observed in aggregate stability between the NM planted soil and the bare soil is interesting.  Soil aggregate stability (mean weight diameter, MWD) did not differ with planting regime in soils treated with the 10-6 dilution.  PC2 differentiated between soil dilution as a single factor (10-1, 5.1; 10-6, -3.5; F1,47=14.33, P<0.001) and this accounted for most of the variation in the ANOVA of PC2 data.  Aggregate stability and ASDCU was also negatively correlated in the bare soil treatments.  At both months 5 and 7, ASDCU was greater in the bare soils than in either planted (AM or NM) soil.\n",
      "This investigation examines the effect of manipulating soil microbial community composition and species richness on the development of soil structure over a seven month period in planted (with or without mycorrhizal fungi) and in unplanted macrocosms.  The dilution method effectively resulted in soil communities with consistently contrasting levels of species (TRF) richness.  In particular, the 10-6 dilution of field soil resulted in less rich communities in bare unplanted soil than did the 10-1 soil dilution.  However, this was not the case in planted soils where root activity was a powerful influence on species richness.  After seven months, principal components analysis (PCA) separated bacterial community composition primarily on planting regime; planted mycorrhizal, planted non-mycorrhizal and bare soil treatments all contained different bacterial community compositions.  A consistent finding in planted and unplanted soils was that aggregate stability was positively correlated with small pore sizes.  Mycorrhizal colonisation decreased plant biomass and also resulted in reduced soil bacterial species richness, lower percentage organic matter and smaller pore sizes relative to planted but non-mycorrhizal soils.  However, soil aggregate stability and water repellency were increased in these (mycorrhizal) soils probably due to AMF hyphal activities including enmeshment and/or glomalin production.  In contrast, bacterial TRF richness was positively correlated with aggregate stability in the bare and non-mycorrhizal planted soils.  Soil organic carbon was an important factor in all treatments, but in the bare soil where there was no additional input of labile C from roots, the percentage C could be directly related to fungal TRF richness.  The less species rich bare soil contained more organic C than the more species rich bare soil.  This suggests a degree of redundancy with regard to mineralisation of organic matter when additional, more utilisable C sources are unavailable.  Understanding the effects of microbial diversity on functional parameters is important for advancing sustainable soil management techniques, but it is clear that soil is a dynamic ecosystem.\n",

      "Summary for Surface waves on Saturn's magnetopause: In Section 4 we showed that the dominant direction of perturbations of the boundary normal, including those normals for crossings clearly associated with waves, is related to the direction of the local magnetospheric field vector, and we highlighted that this magnetic field influence is consistent with K-H instability theory (e.g. Southwood, 1968).  Two initial studies of the orientation of the magnetopause surface, each based on data returned by the Cassini Saturn orbiter during magnetopause crossings that occurred in an interval of a few days, have revealed evidence for wave activity on both the dawn side and on the dusk side (Masters et al., 2009; Cutler et al., 2011).  In this section we examine the nature of perturbations of Saturn's magnetopause surface orientation, given by the difference between measured surface normals and predicted surface normals from a large-scale model of magnetopause morphology (Kanani et al., 2010).  However, since this study uses multiple sets of Cassini magnetopause crossings to carry out a global assessment of surface wave activity on Saturn's magnetopause we can use our larger total crossing set to infer the typical properties of the dominant surface waveform.  In this paper we test the hypothesized dawn-dusk asymmetry in the K-H instability of Saturn's magnetopause for the first time by assessing the extent of surface wave activity using data taken by the Cassini spacecraft during 520 magnetopause crossings.  These results concerning the orientation of Saturn's magnetopause surface suggest that both the MVA and TDA methods generally capture the true surface normal to within an angular uncertainty of roughly 30°, but in some cases the validity of the normals is questionable due to a low magnetic shear and/or a low MVA eigenvalue ratio.  Since we rely on the number of crossings in our data set to reveal the global picture of waves on Saturn's magnetopause surface, we do not omit any crossings on the basis of an inferred low level of confidence in the associated normal.  These surface normals can be compared to the normal predicted by the most recent model of Saturn's large-scale magnetopause surface that was constructed by Kanani et al. (2010).  In this paper we have used data taken by the Cassini spacecraft during 520 crossings of Saturn's magnetopause to examine the nature of wave activity on the boundary.  The crossings associated with waves provide information about the nature of wave activity on Saturn's magnetopause.  To examine the occurrence of surface waves on Saturn's magnetopause we analyzed data taken during 520 crossings of the boundary made by the Cassini spacecraft between 28 June 2004 and 23 July 2007.  Although waves may have been present on the surface for the duration of a set of crossings, other drivers of motion of the boundary (e.g. the magnetospheric period oscillation (Clarke et al., 2006, 2010)) can play a dominant role in determining when spacecraft crossings occurred, each of which provides a \"snapshot\" of the surface orientation.  Fig. 5 shows histograms of parameters resulting from our assessment of the orientation of Saturn's magnetopause for all 477 crossings.  However, if surface wave activity played a sufficiently important role in controlling when the spacecraft crossed the boundary then this should be revealed by the oscillation of consecutive normals about the model normal, and the timing of crossings associated with such normal oscillations can be used to infer the typical wave properties.  We note that the absence of a dawn-dusk asymmetry in wave activity reported here is consistent with studies based on Cassini data that identified initial evidence for waves on both the dawn and dusk side magnetopause (Masters et al., 2009; Cutler et al., 2011), and a study that has demonstrated that there is no clear local time asymmetry in the properties of Saturn's low-latitude boundary layer that could be attributed to a dawn-dusk asymmetry in the growth of the K-H instability at the magnetopause (Masters et al., 2011a).\n",
      "Waves on the surface of a planetary magnetopause promote energy transport into the magnetosphere, representing an important aspect of solar wind-magnetosphere coupling.  At Saturn's magnetopause it has been proposed that growth of the Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) instability produces greater wave activity on the dawn side of the surface than on the dusk side.  We test this hypothesis using data taken by the Cassini spacecraft during crossings of Saturn's magnetopause.  Surface orientation perturbations are primarily controlled by the local magnetospheric magnetic field orientation, and are generally greater at dusk than at dawn.  53% of all crossings were part of a sequence of regular oscillations arising in consecutive surface normals that is strong evidence for tailward propagating surface waves, with no detectable local time asymmetry in this phenomenon.  We estimate the dominant wave period to be ∼5h at dawn and ∼3h at dusk.  The role played by the magnetospheric magnetic field, tailward wave propagation, and the dawn-dusk difference in wave period suggests that K-H instability is a major wave driving mechanism.  Using linear K-H theory we estimate the dominant wavelength to be ∼10 Saturn radii (RS) and amplitude to be ∼1 RS at both dawn and dusk, giving propagation speeds of ∼30 and ∼50kms-1 at dawn and dusk, respectively.  The lack of the hypothesized dawn-dusk asymmetry in wave activity demonstrates that we need to revise our understanding of the growth of the K-H instability at Saturn's magnetopause, which will have implications for the study of other planetary magnetospheres.  ► Surface waves on a planetary magnetopause transport energy into the magnetosphere.  ► Differences in the level of wave activity across Saturn's magnetopause has been predicted.  ► Kelvin-Helmholtz waves often form on Saturn's magnetopause surface.  ► There is no evidence for the predicted difference across the surface.  ► We need to revise our understanding of surface waves on Saturn's magnetopause.\n",

      "Summary for The transterminator ion flow at Venus at solar minimum: Observations of the flux of atomic oxygen ions across the terminator from the day to nightside showed that this ion flux was sufficient to explain the observed ion densities in the nightside ionosphere at solar maximum (Knudsen et al., 1980).  In summary the observations of ion energies indicated that a nightward ion flow across the terminator at solar minimum can occur.  In situ ion observations made by the ASPREA-4 experiment onboard the Venus Express spacecraft at solar minimum have shown dawn-dusk and noon-midnight asymmetries.  The spacecraft velocity at periapsis (∼200km) was ∼10kms-1, which was larger than the ion velocities of ∼3kms-1 observed by PVO at these altitudes (Knudsen and Miller, 1992).  The spacecraft velocity near periapsis was essentially the same for all orbits and all directions of travel and so the difference in the ion energy between the midnight-to-noon and noon-to-midnight traversals, (9±7)eV, may be attributed to the flow of ions.  The dawn-dusk ion asymmetry showed larger numbers of ions on the dusk side than on the dawn side consistent with the previously reported observations of antisunward transterminator flow at solar maximum from PVO.  The larger ion energies in the midnight-to-noon bin suggested that these ions had a velocity component that was antiparallel to the spacecraft direction of travel and the smaller values in the noon-to-midnight bin suggested that these ions had a velocity component that was parallel to the spacecraft direction of travel.  The largest summed ion counts were in the polar region close to periapsis where the spacecraft sampled the lowest altitudes.  This suggested that in a substantial number of cases the ion counts nightward of the terminator were comparable to the values in the dayside ionosphere, although in general the ion counts nightward of the terminator were lower than those observed on the dayside as expected in the absence of a plasma source.  In this region the spacecraft was in the topside ionosphere, where the ion density decreases with increasing altitude.  Variability is observed on the dayside where the counts are expected to decrease away from the terminator as the spacecraft moves to higher altitudes and to increase because of a decreasing solar zenith angle.  This instrument observes the ion energy per charge, E/q, the mass per charge, m/q, and the arrival direction of each ion as well as the number of ions observed.\n",
      "The transterminator ion flow in the Venusian ionosphere is observed at solar minimum for the first time.  Such a flow, which transports ions from the day to the nightside, has been observed previously around solar maximum.  At solar minimum this transport process is severely inhibited by the lower altitude of the ionopause.  The observations presented were those made of the Venusian ionospheric plasma by the ASPERA-4 experiment onboard the Venus Express spacecraft, and which constitute the first extensive in-situ measurements of the plasma near solar minimum.  Observations near the terminator of the energies of ions of ionospheric origin showed asymmetry between the noon and midnight sectors, which indicated an antisunward ion flow with a velocity of (2.5±1.5)kms-1.  It is suggested that this ion flow contributes to maintaining the nightside ionosphere near the terminator region at solar minimum.  The interpretation of the result was reinforced by observed asymmetries in the ion number counts.  The observed dawn-dusk asymmetry was consistent with a nightward transport of ions while the noon-midnight observations indicated that the flow was highly variable but could contribute to the maintenance of the nightside ionosphere.  ► The transterminator ion flow in the Venusian ionosphere is observed at solar minimum.  ► This flow has a velocity of (2.5±1.5)kms-1.  ► The occurrence of this flow is highly variable, but can be a significant source of the nightside ionosphere.\n",

      "Summary for Energy distribution asymmetry of electron precipitation signatures at Mars: We present data from the ELS and IMA, the two plasma instruments on MEX ASPERA-3 (Barabash et al., 2004), to study the energy distributions of electrons and heavy-ions during signatures of electron precipitation at Mars.  We use the space plasma instrumentation of MEX ASPERA-3 to classify the different types of asymmetry found in the energy distributions of electrons and heavy-ions during signatures of electron precipitation at Mars.  The events of electron precipitation signatures were then categorised according to the combinations of asymmetry as defined by the net flux directions found in the energy distributions of the electrons and heavy-ions.  Given these results, the electron signature presented above is classified in an energy distribution category where electrons and heavy-ions both have a coincident distribution directed away from Mars.  Therefore, this could be the observation of electrons and heavy-ions moving away from Mars similar to energy distribution category-4 described in Section 3.4.  Using the ASPERA-3 ELS and IMA instruments we will compare the energy distributions in differential energy flux (DEF) of electrons and heavy-ions at the times of these signatures.  The observations of heavy-ions by IMA show there is a slight increase in the energy of peak DEF during the time of the electron spike signature.  The combination of electron and heavy-ion energy distributions that make up category-2, suggestive of a downward current and category-4 with both up-going electrons and heavy-ions, is only considered for those electron precipitation signatures that have electron energy distributions with a significant asymmetry.  Although the upward net flux direction of electrons for the majority of electron precipitation signatures is questionable, due to the instrumental bias from ELS and the isotropic nature of the energy distributions, an upward net flux of electrons is more definite and believable for cases of energy distributions that are non-isotropic.  Peaked electron, \"inverted-V\" electron and electron spike signatures are observed most with energy distributions that have a net upward flux of electrons.  The right hand panel shows the electron signature has an energy spectrum that is closest to electrons from the magnetosheath and has a main peak in DEF at ∼75eV (∼100eV in PSD).  Even after discounting upward net flux of electrons from those signatures with isotropic electron energy distribution, category-4 still make up the second largest group and when added together with category-2 occur on 10% of MEX orbits.  Fig. 5(b) shows that the peaked electron signature at the centre of the spectrogram in Fig. 5(a) has an energy distribution of electrons that is highly isotropic and illustrates results from previous studies (Brain et al., 2006; Dubinin et al., 2009).  In this study, we will look at the combination of energy distributions of electrons and heavy-ion during signatures of electron precipitation and will attempt to classify different types of particle distribution asymmetries.  At the times of the electron precipitation signatures, heavy-ions are observed most with an asymmetrical energy distribution that has a net upward flux of heavy-ions.  The heavy-ions show very little response to the occurrence of the electron signature apart from a slight increase in energy.  However, this signature is not classified as such since the heavy-ions in this region still form an adequate energy distribution to compare to the electrons.  Looking at Fig. 7(b) the energy distribution during the electron spike signature shows a strong downward direction towards Mars, with a net flux vector of 15° to the Mars nadir.  Note, this result is in conflict with the appearance of the energy spectrum, which suggests the electron spike contains tail electrons precipitating along the crustal magnetic field, unless those electrons have already been reflected by converging magnetic fields.  Fig. 6(b) shows that the energy distribution of the electrons has a clear structure directed away from Mars, whereas the second panel shows that the heavy-ions at ∼400eV are found in the opposite hemisphere of the energy distribution directed towards Mars.\n",
      "The different types of asymmetry observed in the energy distributions of electrons and heavy-ions (M/Q=16-44) during signatures of electron precipitation in the Martian ionosphere have been classified.  This has been achieved using the space plasma instrumentation of MEX ASPERA-3 from peri-centre altitude to 2200km.  ASPERA-3 ELS observes signatures of electron precipitation on 43.0% of MEX orbits.  Unaccelerated electrons in the form of sudden electron flux enhancements are the most common type of electron precipitation signature at Mars and account for ∼70% of the events observed in this study.  Electrons that form unaccelerated electron precipitation signatures are either local ionospheric electrons with enhanced density, or electrons transported from another region of ionosphere, solar wind or tail, or a combination of local and transported electrons.  The heating of electrons has a strong influence on the shape of most electron energy spectra from accelerated precipitation signatures.  On most occasions the general flow of heavy-ions away from Mars is unchanged during the precipitation of electrons, which is thought to be the result of the finite gyroradius effect of the heavy-ions on crustal magnetic field lines.  Only ∼17% of events show some form of heavy-ion acceleration that is either concurrent or at the periphery of an electron precipitation signature.  The most common combination of electron and heavy-ion energy distributions for signatures of electron precipitation involves electrons that visually have very little asymmetry or are isotropic and heavy-ions that have a upward net flux, and suggest the upward current associated with aurora.  Due to a lack of reliable measurements of electrons travelling towards Mars, it is likely we miss further evidence of upward currents.  The second most common combination of electron and heavy-ion energy distributions for signatures of electron precipitation, are those distributions of electrons that are asymmetric and have an net upward flux, with distributions of heavy-ions that also have a net upward flux.  Energy distributions of heavy-ions with a net flux towards Mars occur half as often as heavy-ions with an upward net flux.  There is also evidence to suggest we observe downward currents during electron precipitation signatures when we find energy distributions of electrons that are asymmetric and have an upward net flux, combined with energy distributions of heavy-ions that have a downward net flux.  Wave particle interactions and downward parallel electric fields may be responsible for electrons that display a large amount of asymmetry in the upward direction of the energy distribution and have a upward net flux.  ► We use ASPERA-3 to classify particle asymmetries during electron precipitation at Mars.  ► Most common type of energy distribution is of isotropic electrons and upward heavy-ions.  ► Distributions suggesting upward currents observed four times more than downward currents.  ► Heavy-ion flow at Mars mostly unaffected by electron precipitation due to finite gyro-radius.  ► Acceleration of heavy-ions is rarely observed during electron precipitation.\n",

      "Summary for Response of the Jovian thermosphere to a transient 'pulse' in solar wind pressure: For case CH, Fig. 5(h), we see the effects of plasma super-corotation in region III, where magnetospheric power reverses (now negative) and energy is now transferred from magnetosphere to thermosphere.  For expansions, Cowley et al. (2007) found that the power dissipated in the thermosphere (and used to accelerate magnetospheric plasma) increased by a factor of ~2.5 resulting from a large increase in azimuthal flow shear between the expanded magnetosphere and the thermosphere.  As discussed in Yates et al. (2012), most of the energy in region III is expended in accelerating magnetospheric plasma; in region II we have a situation where magnetospheric power and atmospheric power (the sum of Joule heating and ion drag energy) are equal, due to ΩM=0.5ΩJ.  This change in ΩM (see Fig. 2(b)) increases the flow shear between the magnetosphere and thermosphere and thus increases the FAC density in region III by ~15%.  Fig. 8(g) shows the energy balance in the thermosphere for case ES.  This energy transfer from the magnetosphere would act to, essentially 'spin up' the planet (Cowley et al., 2007) and increase the thermospheric temperature.  The large increase in electron energy flux is caused by a substantial increase in flow shear between the thermosphere and magnetosphere, resulting from the super-corotation of the magnetodisc plasma (see Fig. 2).  Powers decrease in region II due to the decrease in azimuthal flow shear between the magnetosphere and thermosphere (see Fig. 2(a)).  Despite a resemblance in FAC profiles, upward FACs in the magnetodisc (region III) are ~2.5 times larger in case CH than the equivalent case (with a responsive thermosphere) in Cowley et al. (2007).  Yates et al. (2012), whilst investigating the influence of solar wind on the steady-state thermospheric flows of Jupiter, found that ion drag energy and Joule heating increased by ≲200% (from a compressed to expanded magnetospheric configuration) result in a thermospheric temperature increase of ~135K.  This current reversal (compared to case CS) is due to a negative flow shear (ΩT-ΩM) caused by the significant super-corotation of the magnetosphere compared to the thermosphere (see Section 3.4 and Cowley et al., 2007).  Looking now at case EH, and comparing FAC densities with the corresponding result from Cowley et al. (2007) (expansion from 45-85RJ), we notice a few differences: (i) the magnitude of peak upward FAC in case EH is ~25% larger than that in Cowley et al. (2007) and (ii) case EF has no upward FAC at the region II/I boundary, contrary to results in Cowley et al. (2007).  All the changes in flows discussed for case CH result from the super-corotation of the magnetosphere which causes a reversal in the coupling current, subsequently leading to a change in the sign of ion drag momentum terms in region III (see Fig. 9 and corresponding discussion).  The CF thermosphere appears to be transporting heat, both equatorward and poleward from the region III/II boundary (see Fig. 4(f)).  Comparing the energy flux profile of case CH with the equivalent case in Cowley et al. (2007), we see that in the closed field regions (III and II), peak energy fluxes are two orders of magnitude larger in case CH.  For case ES, the zonal (Fig. 7(a)) and meridional (Fig. 7(d)) flows are very similar to those discussed in Yates et al. (2012) as the only difference between both steady-state compressed cases is that here we assume a constant height-integrated Pedersen conductivity whilst in Yates et al. (2012) the conductivity is enhanced by FAC.  Cowley et al. (2007) discussed 'transient' heating and dynamics in terms of power dissipated in the thermosphere via Joule heating and ion drag energy, as well as power used to accelerate magnetospheric plasma.\n",
      "The importance of the Jovian thermosphere with regard to magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling is often neglected in magnetospheric physics.  We present the first study to investigate the response of the Jovian thermosphere to transient variations in solar wind dynamic pressure, using an azimuthally symmetric global circulation model coupled to a simple magnetosphere and fixed auroral conductivity model.  In our simulations, the Jovian magnetosphere encounters a solar wind shock or rarefaction region and is subsequently compressed or expanded.  We present the ensuing response of the coupling currents, thermospheric flows, heating and cooling terms, and the aurora to these transient events.  Transient compressions cause the reversal, with respect to steady state, of magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling currents and momentum transfer between the thermosphere and magnetosphere.  They also cause at least a factor of two increase in the Joule heating rate.  Ion drag significantly changes the kinetic energy of the thermospheric neutrals depending on whether the magnetosphere is compressed or expanded.  Local temperature variations appear between ~-45and175K for the compression scenario and ~-20and50K for the expansion case.  Extended regions of equatorward flow develop in the wake of compression events - we discuss the implications of this behaviour for global energy transport.  Both compressions and expansions lead to a ~2000TW increase in the total power dissipated or deposited in the thermosphere.  In terms of auroral processes, transient compressions increase main oval UV emission by a factor of ~4.5 whilst transient expansions increase this main emission by a more modest 37%.  Both types of transient event cause shifts in the position of the main oval, of up to 1° latitude.  Theoretical study of how rapid solar wind variations affects Jupiter's magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system.  A solar wind shock causes the reversal of currents and angular momentum transfer from the thermosphere to magnetosphere.  Solar wind shocks lead to large regions of equatorward flow in the thermosphere due to the reversal in ion drag acceleration.  These rapid magnetospheric reconfigurations result in local thermospheric temperature increases >25K.\n",

      "Summary for The mechanical properties and toughening mechanisms of an epoxy polymer modified with polysiloxane-based core-shell particles: At a test temperature of 20 °C, the fracture toughness, KIc, of the epoxy polymer increased with the addition of the S-CSR particles, from 0.70 MPam1/2 for the unmodified epoxy polymer to 1.46 MPam1/2 for the polymer containing 20 wt% of the S-CSR particles.  The fracture energies of the S-CSR particle-modified epoxy polymers were measured at a range of temperatures from 20 °C to -109 °C.  However, it is very noteworthy that the addition of the S-CSR particles can significantly toughen the epoxy polymer even at the lowest test temperatures.  Further, the S-CSR particles significantly toughened the epoxy polymer even at cryogenic temperatures.  This observation clearly reveals that plastic void growth of the epoxy polymer has followed cavitation of the S-CSR particles.  Further, as found previously [39,50], the model predicts that at the relatively low test temperatures the former micromechanism based upon plastic localised shear-band yielding in the epoxy polymer dominates, especially for the epoxy polymers containing relatively high concentrations of the S-CSR particles.  AFM of the S-CSR-modified polymers showed that the S-CSR particles were well-dispersed in the epoxy polymer, see Fig. 1(b-d).  The toughening events of the S-CSR particle-modified epoxy polymers can be summarised as localised shear-banding of the epoxy polymer initiated by the particles and internal cavitation of the S-CSR particles (which relieves the triaxial stress-state in the vicinity of the crack tip) followed by void growth.  The plane-strain compression tests demonstrate that the addition of the S-CSR particles suppressed the strain-softening that occurred after yield of the epoxy.  This arises because, firstly, the S-CSR particles still act as points of stress concentration for such deformation to initiate, due to their lower modulus compared to the epoxy polymer over the complete temperate range.  Plastic void growth, following cavitation of the rubber particles, only contributed approximately 35% of the toughening effect at room temperature, and its contribution to the toughness decreased rapidly at low test temperatures, especially for the epoxy polymers containing relatively high concentrations of the S-CSR particles.  The addition of the S-CSR particles did not alter this value, but the elastic modulus and the yield stress of the epoxy were reduced in value.  Indeed, all of the S-CSR particles cavitated, even at -109 °C, although the size of the cavities is reduced at low temperatures, which indicates a lesser extent of plastic void growth in the epoxy polymer.  (The volume fraction of the S-CSR particles in the epoxy polymer was measured using image analysis from the atomic force micrographs).  These results confirm that the S-CSR particles remain phase-separated and do not plasticise the epoxy polymer.  For example, a GIc value of 481 J/m2 was measured for the epoxy containing 20 wt% S-CSR particles at -109 °C.  The addition of the S-CSR particles was found to have no significant effect on Tg of the epoxy polymer when the experimental uncertainty of about ±2 °C is considered, see Table 1.  This would appear to be the shell of the S-CSR particles, and the phase image indicates that this is slightly harder than the epoxy polymer.  Hence, all the S-CSR particles were assumed to initiate shear-bands and to undergo cavitation with subsequent plastic void growth of the epoxy polymer.  The fracture strains of the unmodified and the S-CSR particle-modified epoxy polymers were relatively insensitive to temperature, see Table 2.\n",
      "An epoxy resin, cured using an anhydride hardener, has been modified by the addition of pre-formed polysiloxane core-shell rubber (S-CSR) particles with a mean diameter of 0.18 μm.  The glass transition temperature, Tg, of the cured unmodified epoxy polymer was 148 °C, and this was unchanged after the addition of the S-CSR particles.  The polysiloxane rubber particles had a Tg of about -100 °C.  Atomic force microscopy showed that the S-CSR particles were well-dispersed in the epoxy polymer.  The addition of the S-CSR particles reduced the Young's modulus and tensile strength of the epoxy polymer, but at 20 °C the fracture energy, GIc, increased from 117 J/m2 for the unmodified epoxy to 947 J/m2 when 20 wt% of the S-CSR particles were incorporated.  Fracture tests were also performed at -55 °C, -80 °C, and -109 °C.  The results showed that the measured fracture energy of the S-CSR-modified epoxy polymers decreased significantly below room temperature.  For example, at -109 °C, a fracture energy of 481 J/m2 was measured using 20 wt% of S-CSR particles.  Nevertheless, this value of toughness still represented a major increase compared with the unmodified epoxy polymer, which possessed a value of GIc of 174 J/m2 at this very low test temperature.  Thus, a clear fact that emerged was that the addition to the epoxy polymer of the S-CSR particles may indeed lead to significant toughening of the epoxy, even at temperatures as low as about -100 °C.  The toughening mechanisms induced by the S-CSR particles were identified as (a) localised plastic shear-band yielding around the particles and (b) cavitation of the particles followed by plastic void growth of the epoxy polymer.  These mechanisms were modelled using the Hsieh et al. approach [33,49] and the values of GIc of the S-CSR-modified epoxy polymers at the different test temperatures were calculated.  Excellent agreement was found between the predictions and the experimentally measured fracture energies.  Further, the experimental and modelling results of the present study indicated that the extent of plastic void growth was suppressed at low temperatures for the S-CSR-modified epoxy polymers, but that the localised shear-band yielding mechanism was relatively insensitive to the test temperature.  An epoxy polymer has been modified with polysiloxane core-shell rubber particles.  The epoxy had Tg of about 148 °C and the particles had a Tg of about -100 °C.  AFM showed that the particles were well-dispersed in the epoxy polymer.  The addition of 20 wt% particles increased GIc from about 120 J/m2 to 950 J/m2.  The particles also significantly toughened the epoxy polymer even at about -100 °C.\n",

      "Summary for The modelling of the toughening of epoxy polymers via silica nanoparticles: The effects of volume fraction and particle size: Hence, from both of these observations, it would be expected that all three piperidine-cured epoxy polymers, containing particle sizes of 23, 74 or 170 nm, examined in the present study will exhibit particle debonding, followed by plastic void growth of the epoxy matrix polymer, prior to fracture.  Since there is no significant difference in the measured GC for any particle diameter for a given volume fraction of silica nanoparticles; and noting that the other two particle size particles experimentally, as well as theoretically, showed debonding and void growth.  The effect of the presence of the silica nanoparticles is clearly major, with the epoxy polymers containing 30 vol% of such particles having values of GC of about 1000 J/m2.  Namely, as implied above, the debonding of the silica nanoparticles from the epoxy matrix polymer appears to take place during the elastic deformation region and, as shown in Table 1, the yield stress for all modified epoxy polymers is approximately equal, irrespective of particle size.  The smallest particles employed, i.e. silica nanoparticles of 23 nm diameter, showed no evidence of debonding and subsequent void growth of the epoxy polymer.  Indeed, this value of about 15% only of the silica nanoparticles particles present debonding has also been noted in other published studies, but has never been previously explained.  However, there was no evidence of particle debonding and subsequent plastic void growth in the epoxy polymer, and this of course explains why the particles are more difficult to identify.  Thus, also observing that the contribution of the plastic void growth mechanism to the fracture energy, ΔGv, is predicted to be independent of particle size, it is suggested that particle debonding and subsequent plastic void growth in the epoxy polymer does indeed occur for the 23 nm diameter particles but that it is obscured by the coating process when the FEG-SEM observations are made.  In the present work, it was relatively difficult to clearly observe the 23 nm silica nanoparticles, see Fig. 3(a), although some particles were observed, as indicated by the arrows.  As discussed in detail previously [16], there is no significant effect of the particle size, within experimental error, on the measured values of the fracture energy with the addition of silica nanoparticles, within the range studied of 23-170 nm in particle diameter (see Fig. 1).  However, for all of the different particle diameters, a good agreement with the experimental data was obtained using the model that takes into account both the shear-banding yielding and the debonding and subsequent plastic void growth mechanisms in the epoxy matrix polymer, when the predicted value of about 14% of the nanoparticles present only are active in the latter toughening mechanism.  It should be noted that the contribution to the increase in toughness due to particle debonding is widely considered to be negligible and thus the value of interfacial free energy between the silica nanoparticles and epoxy polymer matrix does not enter into the formulation of the model [21-23].\n",
      "Silica nanoparticles possessing three different diameters (23, 74 and 170 nm) were used to modify a piperidine-cured epoxy polymer.  Fracture tests were performed and values of the toughness increased steadily as the concentration of silica nanoparticles was increased.  However, no significant effects of particle size were found on the measured value of toughness.  The toughening mechanisms were identified as (i) the formation of localised shear-band yielding in the epoxy matrix polymer which is initiated by the silica nanoparticles, and (ii) debonding of the silica nanoparticles followed by plastic void growth of the epoxy matrix polymer.  These mechanisms, and hence the toughness of the epoxy polymers containing the silica nanoparticles, were modelled using the Hsieh et al. approach (Polymer 51, 2010, 6284-6294).  However, it is noteworthy that previous modelling work has required the volume fraction of debonded silica particles to be measured from the fracture surfaces but in the present paper a new and more fundamental approach has been proposed.  Here finite-element modelling has demonstrated that once one silica nanoparticle debonds then its nearest neighbours are shielded from the applied stress field, and hence may not debond.  Statistical analysis showed that, for a good, i.e. random, dispersion of nanoparticles, each nanoparticle has six nearest neighbours, so only one in seven particles would be predicted to debond.  This approach therefore predicts that only 14.3% of the nanoparticles present will debond, and this value is in excellent agreement with the value of 10-15% of those nanoparticles present debonding which was recorded via direct observations of the fracture surfaces.  Further, this value of about 15% of silica nanoparticles particles present debonding has also been noted in other published studies, but has never been previously explained.  The predictions from the modelling studies of the toughness of the various epoxy polymers containing the silica nanoparticles were compared with the measured fracture energies and the agreement was found to be good.\n",

      "Summary for Dual-chamber measurements of δ13C of soil-respired CO2 partitioned using a field-based three end-member model: Assuming that roots, litter/humus, and SOM are the only significant contributors to the total soil surface flux of CO2, RS was partitioned among these three components using the δ13C values of RS (obtained with the dual-chamber), and the δ13C values of the CO2 produced from the three sources, as well as the mass-specific rate of CO2 production by each source (obtained from the incubations).  During the measurements, the dual-chambers were deployed within an area of 4 m2 without altering the litter layer, and inserting the base of the dual-chamber into the soil to a depth of approximately 2-3 cm.  Thus the measurements made at the soil surface do not need to be corrected for fractionation due to diffusion.  In addition, the installation of soil collars several centimetres into the soil, to minimize CO2 leakage in and out of the chamber (Hutchinson and Livingston, 2001), has raised concerns regarding the possibility of measuring δ13CRs beyond the collar insertion depth (Kayler et al., 2008), and their utility in soil respiration partitioning studies (Heinemeyer et al., 2011).  Hence, to correctly partition RS we need to understand the contribution of the depth-related enrichment of soil δ13C-CO2 to surface measurements of δ13CRs.  The use of δ13C for partitioning the contribution of different sources of RS has the advantage of permitting in situ measurements with minimal disturbance to soil and roots (Hanson et al., 2000; Paterson et al., 2009).  Although transient changes in soil diffusivity and CO2 concentration gradient might constantly alter the relative diffusion rates of 12CO2 and 13CO2 isotopologues, Cerling et al. (1991) demonstrated that if soil respiration is at a diffusive steady-state, the δ13C of soil surface flux should theoretically match the δ13C produced within the soil.  In general, to correctly measure δ13CRs it is essential to maintain unbiased the diffusion conditions of RS at soil surface.  In addition, we aimed to partition the soil surface CO2 flux into its components derived from root, litter/humus, and SOM sources and, alternatively, into autotrophic and heterotrophic components.  For this reason, when a background ambient concentration is used in both steady-state and non-steady-state chambers, the vertical gradient of CO2 concentration at soil surface must be carefully considered in order to avoid the alteration of the soil profile CO2 diffusion gradient (Davidson et al., 2002).  However, several decades of experience with chamber-based measurements have revealed numerous potential sources of errors in measuring soil respiration (Davidson et al., 2002).  Since Cerling et al. (1991) demonstrated that if soil respiration is at a diffusive steady-state, the δ13C of the soil surface flux should theoretically match the δ13C produced within the soil, much effort has been put into measuring the δ13C of soil surface CO2.  Depending on the type of soil surface chamber used, RS measurements are generally subject to disturbances which can have a large impact on the certainty of δ13CRs estimates and on subsequent source partitioning.  However, the magnitude of the disturbance created by chambers depends on the soil CO2 production rate, and can vary with soil moisture conditions (Phillips et al., 2010).  Generally, the slower molecular diffusivity of 13CO2 can induce CO2 in bulk soil to be up to 4.4‰ more enriched in 13C than that released at the soil surface δ13CRs (Amundson et al., 1998; Cerling et al., 1991).\n",
      "The contribution of old soil C (SOM) to total soil respiration (RS) in forest has been a crucial topic in global change research, but remains uncertain.  Isotopic methods, such as natural variations in carbon isotope composition (δ13C) of soil respiration, are more frequently being applied, and show promise in separating heterotrophic and autotrophic contributions to RS.  However, natural and artificial modification of δ13CRs can cause isotopic disequilibria in the soil-atmosphere system generating a mismatch between what is usually measured and what process-based models will predict.  Here we report the partitioning of the soil surface CO2 flux in a warm Mediterranean forest into components derived from root, litter/humus, and SOM sources using a new, three end-member mixing model, and compare this with the conventional partitioning into autotrophic and heterotrophic components.  The three end-member mixing model takes into account both the discrimination during CO2 respiration/decomposition of the three components, as well as the fractions of their CO2 fluxes integrated over the total soil profile mass.  In addition, we used a novel dual-chamber technique to ensure that δ13CRs was subjected to minimal artefacts during measurement.  We observed that by using measured soil surface CO2 concentrations as a baseline level for the dual-chamber operation, it was possible to achieve and monitor the necessary conservation of the soil CO2 steady-state diffusion conditions during the measurements, without using permanent collars inserted deeply into the soil.  When RS (8.64 g CO2 m2 d-1) was partitioned into two components, the mean autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration was 56 and 44%, respectively.  When RS was partitioned using the three-way model, however, roots, litter/humus, and SOM contributed 30, 33, and 37% of the total flux.  Our results confirm that to improve the estimates of the partitioning method, it is important to distinguish the fractional contribution of the long-term SOM-derived flux from younger and more labile sources.  ► Natural variations in carbon isotope composition (δ13C) of soil respiration.  ► Dual-chamber technique to ensure that δ13CRs is subjected to minimal artefacts during measurement.  ► Three end-member mixing model for partitioning the soil surface CO2 flux.  ► Fractional contribution of the long-term SOM-derived flux from younger and more labile sources.\n",

      "Summary for The effects of simultaneous root colonisation by three Glomus species on soil pore characteristics: Nevertheless, there is little information on the effects different species of AMF have on aggregate stability or on soil pore dynamics, or indeed whether different AMF species in disturbed conditions have complimentary functions in relation to soil structure.  G. mosseae and G. intraradices have both been shown to grow at least 15 cm away from roots (Jansa et al., 2003, 2005) and the soil staining technique used in this investigation verified the presence of hyphae in all the AMF treatments, in both the rooted and unrooted zones of the macrocosms.  Soil porosity was affected by both AMF species mix (Fig. 3) and by roots (both as single factors, ANOVA, P = 0.015 and P = 0.003 respectively).  Despite the lack of correlation between aggregate stability and AMF, rapid growth of G. mosseae hyphae suggested by Jansa et al. (2008) might be expected to result in alterations in soil structure relative to hyphae of other slower growing species.  Inoculum used in this investigation consisted of three different AMF species: G. geosporum, G. mosseae and G. intraradices, applied as a mixture of substrate containing mycorrhizal roots, spores and extraradical hyphae.  The AMF species used in this investigation originated from the same site, although not from the field where experimental soil was collected.  AMF develop extraradical hyphae which radiate away from the mycorrhizal roots into the surrounding soil.  The data presented here demonstrate that different AMF species within the same genus may have contrasting effects on soil pore characteristics which could alter the micro-physical habitat for other soil organisms.  There has been much interest in the effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) on soil aggregate stabilisation and positive correlations between AMF hyphae and aggregate stability have been recorded, either from the direct effects of the hyphae (Degens et al., 1996; Jastrow et al., 1998) or from indirect effects resulting from glomalin production (Wright and Upadhyaya, 1998; Rillig et al., 2002; Rillig, 2004).  Whilst it has been shown before that different AMF species may affect aggregate stability (Schreiner et al., 1997), the focus here is on the effects of the mycelium in addition to the mycorrhiza.  Roots stabilise soil aggregates through enmeshment and by the release of organic residues that bind soil particles and support many soil organisms, which in turn produce exudates and hyphae that assist in stabilisation (Morel et al., 1991; Jastrow et al., 1998; Hinsinger et al., 2009).  McGonigle et al. (2003) demonstrated that G. mosseae either as a single inoculum or in combination with Gigaspora margarita stimulated maize growth in undisturbed soil.  In contrast to this, Bedini et al. (2009) demonstrated that MWD values of soil aggregates were correlated with total hyphal length (as well as density) of the AMF.  Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed in GenStat Release 13.1 (Lawes Agricultural Trust) to separate effects of AMF species (singly and in mixed inoculum) on plant biomass, and root and hyphal effects on porosity, pore size and aggregate size and stability.  The aim of this investigation was to determine the relationship between three AMF species, a host plant and the development of soil structure in terms of aggregates and resulting porosity.  However in the current study, individual AMF species and combinations of co-occurring AMF species caused short-term effects on pore dynamics which may result in long-term impacts on porosity and aggregate stability.\n",
      "The spatial and temporal nature of the precise interactions between soil fungi and roots and their subsequent role in developing soil structure is still a subject where our understanding is limited.  This research examines the relationship between three species of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF) and soil structural characteristics.  Plantago lanceolata was inoculated with one of: Glomus geosporum, Glomus mosseae or Glomus intraradices, and every combination of the fungal species.  Infectivity was similar for each individual species, but G. mosseae and G. intraradices together resulted in the lowest per cent root length colonised.  Despite the lower percentage colonisation, this combination induced the greatest mycorrhizal growth response.  Aggregate stability and aggregate size distribution were unaffected by AMF but were increased by the presence of roots.  Microbial biomass-C was also enhanced by roots.  Pore size, pore size distribution and nearest neighbour distance were all reduced by G. mosseae and increased by G. intraradices.  All AMF inocula containing G. intraradices resulted in greater distances between pores within the experimental soils.  Porosity (%) was increased by G. mosseae suggesting that more, smaller pores with less distance between them enhanced overall porosity.  ► Soil aggregate stability was increased by plant roots.  ► Aggregate stability was unaffected by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.  ► Pore size was reduced by Glomus mosseae and increased by Glomus intraradices.  ► G. mosseae reduced distance between neighbouring soil pores.  ► G. intraradices increased distance between neighbouring soil pores.\n",

      "Summary for Fungal networks in yield-invigorating and -debilitating soils induced by prolonged potato monoculture: OTUH4+H5 had 34 members in total (Fig. 4), 28 (82%) of which were also found in diseased network and were associated with the modules whose eigengenes were significantly correlated with one or more soil variables.  As shown in Fig. 1, networks with 150 and 171 nodes were constructed from healthy and diseased soil samples respectively.  Soil OM was the key variable associated with the healthy community, as it stimulated members of H6 and H7 modules in healthy network but stimulated no module members in diseased network (Table 1).  OTU910 belonging to Trichoderma stromaticum, for example, was one of D2 members, and was found in healthy network in module H7 whose eigengene was positively correlated with soil OM and NO3--N.  P47E2 as generalists resided in H2 and H5 modules both irresponsive to soil EC in healthy network (Fig. 2, Table 2), but became specialists residing in D4 module that was negatively correlated with EC only in diseased network (Table 2).  Thirdly, module members OTUH4 + H5 and OTUD2 + D6 were irresponsive to any measured soil variables in their respective networks but majority of which were found to be responsive in the counterpart network (Fig. 4).  The same OTU resided in diseased network in D1 whose eigengene was significantly negatively correlated with soil pH.  By using the network analysis tool, what a yield-invigorating (healthy) or -debilitating (diseased) soil fungal community was, what a healthy or a diseased soil was, how a healthy community became diseased, and what was the major cause(s) for the community shift were conceptualized.  In present work, module eigengenes (the Ф values shown in Fig. 1) explained 38-63% of the variations of RA across different samples in healthy network and 37-63% of that in diseased network.  Because a module can be regarded as a group of co-expressed genes and a meta-module as a group of modules functionally interrelated (Langfelder and Horvath, 2007; Oldham et al., 2008), our data suggested that more number of OTUs in healthy network were functionally interrelated than in diseased network.  Synthesized from above results, a conceptual picture appeared on what a healthy or a diseased soil fungal community was, what a healthy or a diseased soil was, how a healthy community became diseased, and what was the major cause(s) leading to the community shift in soils under prolonged potato monoculture.  A conceptual picture on what was a healthy or a diseased soil could be perceived by looking at the responses of majority of fungal community members to soil variables.  These values were similar to those found in human (Langfelder and Horvath, 2007) as well as in soil bacteria eigengene networks (Deng et al., 2012), suggesting that the eigengenes in present work represent the module profiles relatively well and thus are qualified for eigengene network analysis.  Firstly, the generalist OTUs in healthy network were found to be specialist OTUs in diseased networks (Fig. 3), suggesting their role-shifts.  gM-156 and OTU464 belonging to Gibellulopsis nigrescens as generalists resided in the H6 and H5 modules both irresponsive to TN, NH4+-N and EC in healthy network, but became specialists residing in D3 module that was negatively correlated with TN and NH4+-N and positively correlated with EC in diseased network.  This module contained 33 OTUs, accounting for only 19% of total OTUs in diseased network.\n",
      "Most previous studies on soil microbial communities have been focused on species abundance and diversity, but not the interactions among species.  In present study, the Molecular Ecological Network Analysis tool was used to study the interactions and network organizations of fungal communities in yield-invigorating (healthy) and -debilitating (diseased) soils induced by prolonged potato monoculture, based on the relative abundances of internal transcribed spacer sequences derived using pyrosequencing.  An emphasis was placed on the differences between the healthy and diseased networks.  The constructed healthy and diseased networks both showed scale-free, small world and modular properties.  The key topological properties and phylogenetic composition of the two networks were similar.  However, major differences included: a) the healthy network had more number of functionally interrelated operational taxonomic units (OTUs) than the diseased one; b) healthy network contained 6 (4%) generalist OTUs whereas the diseased contained only 1 (0.6%) marginal generalist OTU; and c) majority (55%) of OTUs in healthy soils were stimulated by a certain set of soil variables but the majorities (63%) in diseased soils were inhibited.  Based on these data, a conceptual picture was synthesized: a healthy community was a better organized or a better operated community than the diseased one; a healthy soil was a soil with variables that encouraged majority of fungi whereas a diseased soil discouraged.  By comparing the topological roles of different sets of shared OTUs between healthy and diseased networks, it was found that role-shifts prevailed among the network members such as generalists/specialists, significant module memberships and the OTU sets irresponsive to soil variables in one network but responsive in the counterpart network.  Soil organic matter was the key variable associated with healthy community, whereas ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) and Electrical conductivity (EC) were the key variables associated with diseased community.  Major affected phylogenetic groups were Sordariales and Hypocreales.  We constructed and compared two fungal networks from healthy and diseased soils.  We conceptually depictured what a healthy or a diseased community/soil was.  Nodes' role-shift prevailed when a healthy network changed to diseased one.  Soil organic matter, NH4+-N and EC were the key responsible variables.  Major affected phylogenetic groups were Sordariales and Hypocreales.\n",

      "Summary for Halide doping effects on transparent conducting oxides formed by aerosol assisted chemical vapour deposition: The effects of the dopants were clear, with far higher charge carrier concentration, (N), than those found for undoped SnO2 thin films (1017-19cm-3 range) [1,2,5].  The nanocrystalline properties of the films are evidenced by both the broad SnO2 grain surface vibration band at ≈570cm-1 and the peak at ≈250cm-1, reinforcing calculated crystallite values [22,23].  The results reinforce the position of fluorine as the best dopant and yield insight into the interaction between precursor components prior to thin film deposition; namely that of a halide exchange reaction.  The well-known facetted structure of doped tin oxide thin films is again observed and is indicative of a surface-nucleated thin film growth process [6,24,25].  Hall Effect measurements identified all films as n-type semiconductors.  Films also show reasonably good charge carrier mobility, (μ), values, which may be constricted due to the high charge carrier concentration values obtained.  Values also indicate doping with fluorine results in smaller average crystallites as compared to the other halide dopants.  We have also demonstrated that high-performing TCOs can be obtained from doping SnO2 with halide dopants using AACVD.  Whilst the effects of the fluorine dopant are clear, the differences between the alternative halide-doped SnO2 thin films are quite marginal, however there is seemingly a trend for an increased red-shift in the plasmon absorption edge with increasing halide size.  Film thickness measurements were carried out on a Filmetrics F20 analyser in against an as-supplied FTO reference.  For all doped films, there is a strong preferred orientation along the (211) direction, as demonstrated by texture coefficient calculations; larger values indicating greater directionality [6,15].\n",
      "We report on the effect of halide doping on the Aerosol-assisted Chemical Vapour Deposition of tin oxide.  Specifically, the importance of precursor interactions is highlighted.  A halide exchange reaction involving part substitution of the tin precursor is believed to occur in the solvent; the complex acting as a marker for improved films with improved transparent-conducting properties.  Precursor mixtures of butyltin trichloride and potassium halide (X=F, Cl, Br, I) in propan-2-ol were deposited at a substrate temperature of 450°C using air carrier gas.  Hall Effect results indicate that fluorine gave the best performing n-type transparent conducting thin films that exhibited high optical transparency (>80% at 550nm) and resistivity values of 4.9×10-4Ω.cm, with charge carrier density and carrier mobility values of 8.85×1020cm-3 and 15cm3/V.s respectively.  Such parameters yield high figures of merit.  ► Halide-doped tin oxide films were grown on glass using AACVD.  ► Fluorine is confirmed as the most effective dopant for TCO applications.  ► A halide exchange process resulting in a direct tin-dopant bond in the precursor.  ► This structure is thought a marker to higher-performing films.\n",

      "Summary for Coherent clusters in source code: As there are programs containing much larger coherent clusters, a program is placed in this group if it has a large cluster between the size 10% and 50%.  We also found evidence of super-large clusters: 40% of the programs had a dependence cluster that consumed over half of the program.  For our empirical study we use the size of individual clusters and the cluster profile to find mappings between the clusters and program components.  However, \"zooming\" in reveals that the cluster is actually composed of several smaller clusters made from slices of very similar size.  Other than the largest cluster which covers 48% of the program, the rest of the clusters are extremely small.  It is interesting to note that although this grouping is based only on the largest cluster, many of the programs contain multiple large coherent clusters.  Coherent clusters are dependence clusters that include not only an internal dependence requirement (each statement of a cluster depends on all the other statements of the cluster) but also an external dependence requirement.  However, unlike a2ps the large coherent cluster does not break into smaller clusters but only drops in size.  Even more interestingly, the source code of these two files (scan.c and bc.c) map only to Cluster 2 and none of the other top five clusters.  In this case the largest cluster has a significant drop in size but does not break into multiple smaller clusters.  In other words, a program is said to contain a large coherent cluster if 10% of the program's SDG vertices produce the same backward slice as well as the same forward slice.  The study exploits this unique property of coherent clusters to investigate whether or not a backward slice taken with respect to a vertex of a coherent cluster includes vertices of another cluster.  Small consists of seven programs none of which have a coherent cluster constituting over 10% of the program vertices.  In this case, a drop in the cluster size also leads to breaking of the cluster in to multiple smaller clusters.  Comparing the definitions for slice-based clusters (Definition 2.2) and same-slice clusters (Definition 2.3), a slice-based cluster includes only the internal requirement that the vertices of a cluster depend upon one another.  The case studies form a major contribution of the paper and collectively address research question RQ4: Which structures within a program can coherent cluster analysis reveal? As coherent clusters consist of program vertices that are mutually inter-dependent and share extra-cluster properties we consider such vertices of the cluster to be tightly coupled.\n",
      "Introduction of efficient clustering algorithm.  Empirical analysis to assess the frequency and size of coherent clusters.  A series of case studies showing how clusters identify logical program structures.  A study on the relationship between coherent clusters and program faults.  A study on the relationship between coherent clusters and system evolution.  This paper presents the results of a large scale empirical study of coherent dependence clusters.  All statements in a coherent dependence cluster depend upon the same set of statements and affect the same set of statements; a coherent cluster's statements have 'coherent' shared backward and forward dependence.  We introduce an approximation to efficiently locate coherent clusters and show that it has a minimum precision of 97.76%.  Our empirical study also finds that, despite their tight coherence constraints, coherent dependence clusters are in abundance: 23 of the 30 programs studied have coherent clusters that contain at least 10% of the whole program.  Studying patterns of clustering in these programs reveals that most programs contain multiple substantial coherent clusters.  A series of subsequent case studies uncover that all clusters of significant size map to a logical functionality and correspond to a program structure.  For example, we show that for the program acct, the top five coherent clusters all map to specific, yet otherwise non-obvious, functionality.  Cluster visualization also brings out subtle deficiencies in program structure and identifies potential refactoring candidates.  A study of inter-cluster dependence is used to highlight how coherent clusters are connected to each other, revealing higher-level structures, which can be used in reverse engineering.  Finally, studies are presented to illustrate how clusters are not correlated with program faults as they remain stable during most system evolution.\n",

      "Summary for Using SPIN for automated debugging of infinite executions of Java programs: This abstraction method, called state hashing, is suitable for checking cycles in Spin, and it can be used to detect cycles in the Java program and to check LTL liveness formulas in infinite executions of Java programs.  We now describe how the projection of Java states is constructed and the correctness relation between the evaluation results regarding the original traces, and the projected ones on Spin.  If an infinite cycle is located in the folded states, Spin will not be informed of any new Java state, and thus Spin will not be aware that the Java program is going to loop endlessly in those states.  Recall that counter and hash projections of Java traces t (ρVc(t) and ρVh(t)) discard all program variables except the ones in V, which are the only ones needed to check a temporal formula f, (V=var(f)), while the rest of the state is collapsed into a single variable.  Although the execution of a Java program results in a linear sequence of states, the addition of the Büchi automaton representing the LTL formula may result in several branches that must be explored exhaustively.  Given a Java trace t, a temporal formula f and a subset of program variables V⊆Var, if var(f)⊆V then(6)t⊨f⇔ρV(t)⊨f,  Spin processes the information reported by the monitoring module for each execution of the program, and checks the LTL formula.  In our particular use of Spin, states are produced by the execution of Java programs.  Instead, Spin will be given projections of traces, some Java states are discarded, and the states that are transferred are simplified.  In this paper we propose a method to convert a Java execution trace into a sequence of states that can be analyzed by the model checker Spin (Holzmann, 2003).  Each state si handled by Spin is composed of three components 〈j, ρ(σj), bi〉, where bi is the state of the Büchi automata which is executed synchronously with the system, σj is the current Java state provided by the runtime monitoring module, and ρ is a projection function used to simplify the Java states before being analyzed by Spin.  We take advantage of these C oriented features to communicate Spin with the JDI-based monitor, to represent the Java states in Spin, and to implement our abstraction methods for Java states, explained in Section 3.1.3.  Thereby, we can check complex correctness requirements, like LTL properties, on the Java execution.  As Spin implements the analysis of LTL formulas by translation to Büchi automata, thanks to our method to feed Java executions to Spin as input, we can check the formulas on Java programs with infinite cycles.\n",
      "We use linear time temporal logic to represent both failures and desirable behaviors regarding a temporally ordered sequence of events and/or conditions to be checked along one execution.  We use model checking algorithms record the history of the failed execution, which we use to implement a controlled replay to locate the bugs.  We support the analysis of potentially infinite executions.  We use runtime techniques to start the debugging work directly on the programmer's code.  This paper presents an approach for the automated debugging of reactive and concurrent Java programs, combining model checking and runtime monitoring.  Runtime monitoring is used to transform the Java execution traces into the input for the model checker, the purpose of which is twofold.  First, it checks these execution traces against properties written in linear temporal logic (LTL), which represent desirable or undesirable behaviors.  Second, it produces several execution traces for a single Java program by generating test inputs and exploring different schedulings in multithreaded programs.  As state explosion is the main drawback to model checking, we propose two abstraction approaches to reduce the memory requirements when storing Java states.  We also present the formal framework to clarify which kinds of LTL safety and liveness formulas can be correctly analysed with each abstraction for both finite and infinite program executions.  A major advantage of our approach comes from the model checker, which stores the trace of each failed execution, allowing the programmer to replay these executions to locate the bugs.  Our current implementation, the tool TJT, uses Spin as the model checker and the Java Debug Interface (JDI) for runtime monitoring.  TJT is presented as an Eclipse plug-in and it has been successfully applied to debug complex public Java programs.\n",

      "Summary for Bacterial involvement in otitis media with effusion: The results show that combining culture and confocal microscopy enables demonstration of live bacteria in more than 90% of OME samples, strongly suggesting a role for bacteria in the aetiopathogenesis of OME.  To demonstrate bacteria and biofilms in OME, an alternative approach was adopted in this study.  It is unclear why the present study identified the three traditional OME bacteria in a lower proportion of samples than other studies.  The fact that some effusions containing biofilms on confocal microscopy were culture positive is not surprising as bacteria from biofilms frequently leave the biofilm to enter the planktonic state (and would therefore be culturable), and processing of samples for analysis may also disrupt the biofilm thus rendering the bacteria planktonic and the culture positive.\n",
      "Otitis media with effusion (OME), a common chronic childhood condition affecting hearing, is thought to be a result of bacterial infection, with biofilms recently implicated.  Although bacterial DNA can be detected by polymerase chain reaction in 80% of patients, typically fewer than half of effusions are positive using standard culture techniques.  We adopted an alternative approach to demonstrating bacteria in OME, using a bacterial viability stain and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM): staining allows detection of live bacteria without requiring growth on culture, while CLSM allows demonstration of the three-dimensional structure typical of biofilms.\n",

      "Summary for Leaving flatland: Diagnostics for Lagrangian coherent structures in three-dimensional flows: For the ABC model, when Sv was small, the analysis indicated that both approximations adequately described both LCS positions and peak FTLE values regardless of Sw (Section 4.2).  The role of Sv and Sw in determining the accuracy of the two FTLE approximations given in Section 2 is first tested on the ABC flow.  When Sv is small, both FTLE approximations (FTLE3d2d and FTLE2d2d) adequately capture much of the larger-scale LCS structure (Fig. 3).  Plots of RMS FTLE differences (computed over the entire domain) as a function of max(Sw) are shown in Fig. 9(f).  We study the impact of the vertical velocity and the vertical shear of the horizontal velocity components on the FTLE approximations in two analytic 3D flows.  Analysis of the ABC flow (Section 4) identified the important role that vertical shear of the horizontal velocity plays in 3D LCS.  For moderate to large Sv values, neither approximation adequately delineated the 2D LCS (Section 4.1).  To assess the validity of the two FTLE approximations defined in Section 2 for flows with representative geophysical velocity scalings, we now appeal to the quadrupole model described in Section 3.2.  Like the ABC flow, it also allows Sv and Sw to be varied independently, so that the relative importance of vertical velocities and vertical (u,v) shear can be examined separately.  Plots of RMS FTLE differences (computed over the entire domain) as a function of Sv (Fig. 5(f)) confirm this steady degradation in both approximations over the range of Sv considered here.  RMS FTLE differences (Fig. 5(f)) are convenient metrics for demonstrating the relationship between increasing Sv and decreasing accuracy in FTLE approximations.  It is well known that LCS delineated by invariant manifolds and those derived from FTLE are equivalent for simple analytically prescribed flows.  To allow for more direct comparisons between quadrupole experiments with w≠0, we choose to fix the maximum vertical velocity magnitude (|w|max) at the analysis depth z=-0.3km at 10-4ms-1 in all cases.  Figs. 7 and 8 show that, even for large max(Sw), both approximations capture the LCS structure adequately.  To assess the impacts of these neglected velocity gradient components, 2D LCS derived from FTLE ridges are considered.  Fig. 5 suggests that accuracy of the two FTLE approximations degrades steadily as Sv increases.  Nonzero vertical (u,v) shear with zero vertical velocity (max(Sv)≠0,w=0,Sw=0).  At all max(Sw) values considered, the RMS differences show that FTLE3d2d is a better approximation than FTLE2d2d.  We hypothesize that here the primary direction of dispersion lies in the horizontal plane, resulting in similar FTLE values for the approximations.\n",
      "Finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLE) are often used to identify Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS).  Most applications are confined to flows on two-dimensional (2D) surfaces where the LCS are characterized as curves.  The extension to three-dimensional (3D) flows, whose LCS are 2D structures embedded in a 3D volume, is theoretically straightforward.  However, in geophysical flows at regional scales, full prognostic computation of the evolving 3D velocity field is not computationally feasible.  The vertical or diabatic velocity, then, is either ignored or estimated as a diagnostic quantity with questionable accuracy.  Even in cases with reliable 3D velocities, it may prove advantageous to minimize the computational burden by calculating trajectories from velocities on carefully chosen surfaces only.  When reliable 3D velocity information is unavailable or one velocity component is explicitly ignored, a reduced FTLE form to approximate 2D LCS surfaces in a 3D volume is necessary.  The accuracy of two reduced FTLE formulations is assessed here using the ABC flow and a 3D quadrupole flow as test models.  One is the standard approach of knitting together FTLE patterns obtained on adjacent surfaces.  The other is a new approximation accounting for the dispersion due to vertical (u,v) shear.  The results are compared with those obtained from the full 3D velocity field.  We introduce two diagnostic quantities to identify situations when a fully 3D computation is required for an accurate determination of the 2D LCS.  For the ABC flow, we found the full 3D calculation to be necessary unless the vertical (u,v) shear is sufficiently small.  However, both methods compare favorably with the 3D calculation for the quadrupole model scaled to typical open ocean conditions.  Approximations of 2D Lagrangian coherent structures in 3D flows are studied.  Vertical shear is shown to be important in the three-dimensional flows.  A new approximate Cauchy-Green tensor without using vertical velocities is proposed.  Two velocity gradient diagnostics help to decide when the full 3D velocity is needed.\n",

      "Summary for Fabrication of calcium phosphate fibres through electrospinning and sintering of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles: XPS spectra obtained for (a) PLGA-HA fibres, (b) HA nanopowder, (c) CaP fibres.  Moreover, consultation of the literature indicates that the spectra observed for CaP fibres is typical for a mixture of HA and β-tricalcium phosphate [22-24].  FTIR analysis confirmed that the polymer was burnt out and evaporated during the thermal treatment since no characteristic of PLGA was observed in the spectrum of CaP fibres.  For comparison purposes, the X-ray diffraction of the HA nanopowder and of the PLGA-HA fibres were also recorded.  Therefore fibres prepared from a solution containing highly concentrated HA nanoparticles (50% w/v) were selected for this work.  As controls, HA nanopowder and PLGA-HA fibres were also analysed.  Wu et al. have created HA microfibres by electrospinning a polymer mixture containing Ca(NO3)2·4H2O, (C2H5O)3PO (precursors) and by performing a thermal treatment on the collected fibres at 600°C for 1h [13].  The spectra obtained from pure PLGA fibres and from HA nanopowder serve as controls.  Usually, the degradability of CaP materials varies according to the Ca/P ratio, with β-TCP being more soluble than HA [4].  The slightly lower percentage of oxygen in CaP fibres, compared to the HA nanopowder, may result from the loss of OH groups (dehydroxylation) that occur at high temperature.  Among CaP materials, synthetic hydroxyapatite (HA, Ca10PO46·(OH)2) and β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP, Ca3(PO4)2) are most widely used.  Pure PLGA fibres, PLGA-HA composite fibres and pure HA nanopowders were also analysed as controls.\n",
      "Calcium phosphate (CaP) materials such as synthetic hydroxyapatite (HA, Ca10(PO4)6·(OH)2) and β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP, Ca3(PO4)2) are well-known for their potential in bone tissue engineering and drug delivery applications.  Processing such materials into submicrofibres might contribute to improve their biocompatibility.  This paper presents a new method for creating CaP submicrofibres through the electrospinning route.  A thermal treatment at sintering temperature (1100°C) was applied to electrospun polymer fibres filled with hydroxyapatite nanoparticles to cause aggregation of the nanoparticles and vaporise the polymer matrix.  The images taken by electron microscopy revealed that the treated samples maintained their submicrofibrous morphology.  Moreover, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis confirmed that the resulting fibres are made of hydroxypatite and tricalcium phosphates.  CaP submicrofibres can be produced by using a combination of electrospinning and sintering.  Electrospun fibres were produced from a PLGA solution highly concentrated with HA nanoparticles.  Heat treatments were applied to evaporate the polymer and induce sintering of the nanoparticles.  Hydroxypatite was identified to be the main material in the sintered scaffold.  Approach potentially applicable to make submicrofibres from a variety of ceramic material.\n",

      "Summary for Direct observation of solute-dislocation interaction on screw dislocation in a neutron irradiated modified 316 stainless steel: Under irradiation, it is thought that the high mobility of undersized interstitial atoms, by a mixed dumb-bell mechanism in the matrix and pipe diffusion of Si in screw dislocation cores induced the formation of kinks in the screw dislocation, and the edge component caused significant Si and Ni segregation.  Therefore, the core of the screw dislocation is considered to form kinks or jogs with an edge component, which shows interstitial bias.  In this study, we apply the method to liner screw dislocations to discuss the solute-screw dislocation interaction under neutron irradiation.  In the Fe, Cr, Ni, and Si mapping, periodic fluctuations in solute concentration along the dislocation core were observed.  In the Fe, Cr, Ni, and Si mapping, periodic fluctuations in solute concentration along dislocation cores was observed with a wavelength of approximately 3-4nm.  Using conventional methods, it is difficult to analyze solute atoms trapped at the core of dislocations, and it is also difficult to clarify which solute atom is dominant in the solute-screw dislocation interactions.  Hence, it can be assumed that the kink and/or jog formation on screw dislocation affects the irradiation softening.  In case of heavily irradiated matrix, many undersized atoms arrive at screw dislocation core, even in the absence of any driving force at the core, and eventually, get trapped at screw dislocation core.  The enrichment of undersized atoms at the cores of the screw dislocations suggests that a mixed dumb-bell mechanism occurred during neutron irradiation.  Fig. 1(a) shows the typical three-dimensional atom map of Si before irradiation.\n",
      "A three-dimensional atom probe (3DAP) technique was used to observe the three-dimensional solute distribution around screw dislocations in neutron-irradiated modified 316 austenitic stainless steel.  Si, Ni, and P were observed to get enriched around the cores of screw dislocations, while Fe, Cr, Mn, and Mo were depleted in the same areas.  Si was segregated to a narrow region in the core for which, it was concluded that Si was trapped in the initial stage of segregation.  Other enriched elements segregated to some edge features such as kinks and/or jogs formed as a result of Si trapping.  The results suggest that solute-dislocation interaction of screw dislocations was similar to radiation-induced segregation, which is affected by the volume size factor of solute atoms.  We observed screw dislocations in an irradiated 316 austenitic stainless steel by 3DAP.  Solute segregation around screw dislocation core was similar to radiation induced segregation.  Solute dislocation interaction on screw dislocations is affected by volume size factor.  Segregation behavior at screw dislocations suggests that a mixed dumb-bell mechanism occurred.\n",

      "Summary for An investigation of plate-type windborne debris flight using coupled CFD-RBD models.: The results for these two cases are shown in Fig. 15(a) and (b) and reveal that the plate changes from a flutter mode of flight for F4, to an autorotational mode of flight for F1.  Fig. 18(a) and (b) shows instantaneous snapshots of the plate during flight for all three simulations.  Fig. 13 shows instantaneous snapshots of a plate in each of the four flight modes.  Model experiments and full-scale tests on plates were conducted and the plate's mode of motion was observed, together with measurements of plate trajectory, and velocities, all of which are affected by the wind field, model characteristics, and initial support configuration.  For plates of same B/L, K, and initial angle of attack, different flight modes may be observed due to changes in Δzz and τ.  Similar findings have been reported from recent destructive wind tunnel studies of launch and flight of a plate from a low rise building roof by Kordi and Kopp (2011).  For example, cases D1, D2 and D3 correspond to Tachikawa numbers of 8.325, 6.374 and 4.683 for plates that were expected to enter the autorotational flight mode.  Based on the results from fluttering and transitional plates, it might be postulated that provided the flight duration is long enough and the mass moment of inertia of the plate is sufficiently large to allow plate autorotation, a free-flying plate will enter into autorotation at a stable value of ω¯o, regardless of the initial orientation.  As described earlier, Tachikawa (1983) showed that debris trajectories are sensitive to the properties of the flow and the plate, not just its initial orientation.  Based on the results of CFD-RBD simulations, four primary flight modes have been confirmed, which depend on the initial orientation of the plate: autorotational, transitional, flutter and complex 3D spinning.  This work has provided some insights into the influence of initial conditions (i.e. the fixing conditions and complex flow environment around the plate initially mounted on a roof) and flow turbulence to the mechanics of plate flight.  The distance that the plate is likely to fly has been shown to be dependent on the direction of rotation, with the autorotational effects resulting in plates over-speeding with a non-dimensionalised horizontal speed greater than 1, or flying with a non-dimensionalised speed consistently below 1.  In all three modes, the terminal vertical velocity of the plate is found to be relatively independent of initial orientation.  The horizontal velocity is however strongly influenced by the rotational direction of the plate.  They observed that with oblique wind approach angles relative to the roof ridge, complex 3D spinning was the most dominant mode of flight and that the mode of flight was dependent on the approaching wind direction.  For the plate shown with counter-clockwise (positive) rotational speed, the horizontal and vertical forces acting on the plate over a rotational cycle are(2)FX=DH+LV,(3)FY=DV-LH-mg,where DH and LH are respectively the drag and lift forces acting on the plate due to the relative horizontal wind speed, Uw-up, and DV and LV are the drag and lift forces acting on the plate due to the relative vertical wind speed, -vp.  The plate trajectory is shown to be significantly affected by the flow field at the launch position, most notably, the suction pressures at the eaves which create the large positive vertical velocity, and a slight negative initial horizontal velocity.  The same arguments as those above hold, except that the lift force due to the vertical component of the falling plate serves to keep the mean horizontal velocity, v¯<1.0, as seen in Fig. 7(c).  In summary, the terminal vertical and horizontal speeds of the plate are therefore thought to be controlled by the autorotational drag and lift associated with the non-linear interaction between the plate and the flow.\n",
      "A coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics-Rigid Body Dynamics (CFD-RBD) model is presented, which is capable of modelling the 3D flight of plate-type windborne debris.  The RBD model is based on rotational quaternions, which means that complex spinning modes of flight can be modelled accurately and robustly.  For debris that is free to fly in the absence of obstructions, it is shown that, depending on the initial plate orientation, a number of distinct flight modes are observed.  When the plate is aligned at right angles to the flow, the flight mode depends critically on the initial angle of attack.  The plate may wobble or flutter as it flies, never completing a full rotation, or it may enter an autorotational flight mode.  Depending on the direction of rotation, the plate is capable of flying faster than the wind.  It does this by converting some of its potential energy into rotational energy.  The rotation of the plate causes the forces acting on the plate to further accelerate or decelerate it, depending on the rotation direction.  When the plate is not aligned at right angles to the flow, the plate always enters a complex 3D spinning mode, with significant crosswind motion, which is absent when the plate is aligned at right angles to the flow.  This spinning mode is more typical of plates flying in real wind storms.  In addition, using a porous region to represent a simple double-eaved building, plates are launched from the roof and their trajectory is simulated.  The complex flow fields around the building result in more realistic plate trajectories.  For this particular scenario, large suctions on the windward slope of the roof produce large amounts of lift in the plates released from that position, causing them to fly well above the building, never entering the wake of the building.  ► We use CFD coupled to Rigid Body Dynamics to study the flight of windborne debris.  ► Different modes of flight are identifiable, dependent on the initial orientation.  ► Some debris flies faster than the wind as potential energy is converted to kinetic.  ► Plates are shown launched from the roof of a typical building.  ► The predicted flights compare well with limited experimental observations.\n",

      "Summary for An assessment of a three-beam Doppler lidar wind profiling method for use in urban areas: Wind speed observations from the lidar using the DBS method were compared with data from a sonic anemometer located at 190m during the period 06/07/2010-11/01/2012.  This instrument will be used as a reference with which to compare wind data gathered by the lidar.  Fig. 7 shows the 60min averaged horizontal wind speeds obtained using the lidar DBS method and the sonic anemometer.  Although the corrections applied by Barlow et al. (2011b) were small (≈2% of the mean wind speed), data from the sonic anemometer are examined here to determine whether flow distortion has a substantial effect on the instrument in this new position.  These three scans can all be carried out using a single Doppler lidar, but two or more lidars may also be used to measure different components of the wind in a common volume (Collier et al., 2005), or to create a 'virtual tower' (Calhoun et al., 2006) using intersecting RHI scans for measuring wind profiles.  The mean difference between the two instruments remains fairly constant, with the lidar overestimating the wind speed by between 0 and 0.5ms-1.  Compared to other lidar wind profiling methods (e.g. VAD), which take many more samples, DBS is relatively fast.  A linear fit has been applied to the data using a weighted total least squares, with the weighting determined by the sampling error of each hourly mean wind speed from both the sonic anemometer and the lidar (Section 2.2.4).  Data collected when the sonic anemometer records a wind direction between 315° and 45° are removed as wind speed data from the sonic anemometer in these conditions is considered to be unreliable.  In order to evaluate the performance of the DBS scanning technique, data from the sonic anemometer at the BT Tower was compared with data from the lidar gate corresponding to the height of the BT Tower instruments.  An estimate of the uncertainty of the lidar wind speeds was calculated and the suitability of the DBS method for urban wind profiling was assessed.  Fig. 8 shows the mean difference between wind speeds measured by the lidar and sonic anemometer against anemometer wind speed.  The lidar has several built-in scanning modes, including a DBS wind profiling setting which is used here.  At wind speeds greater than 20ms-1 the lidar appears to be overestimating the wind speed.  Another potential source of error in the lidar wind speed measurements is a tilting of the instrument so that the beam is slightly offset from its intended position.  In order to compare data from an anemometer with the lidar, the height above ground of the anemometer must exceed the minimum range of the lidar.\n",
      "Currently there are few observations of the urban wind field at heights other than rooftop level.  Remote sensing instruments such as Doppler lidars provide wind speed data at many heights, which would be useful in determining wind loadings of tall buildings, and predicting local air quality.  Studies comparing remote sensing with traditional anemometers carried out in flat, homogeneous terrain often use scan patterns which take several minutes.  In an urban context the flow changes quickly in space and time, so faster scans are required to ensure little change in the flow over the scan period.  We compare 3993h of wind speed data collected using a three-beam Doppler lidar wind profiling method with data from a sonic anemometer (190m).  Both instruments are located in central London, UK; a highly built-up area.  Based on wind profile measurements every 2min, the uncertainty in the hourly mean wind speed due to the sampling frequency is 0.05-0.11ms-1.  The lidar tended to overestimate the wind speed by ≈0.5ms-1 for wind speeds below 20ms-1.  Accuracy may be improved by increasing the scanning frequency of the lidar.  This method is considered suitable for use in urban areas.  There is a need for more wind speed data collected above rooftop level in cities.  Remote sensing instruments can measure throughout the boundary layer.  Rapid evolution of the flow above cities means a short scan time is needed.  Data using a 3-beam Doppler lidar profiling method was compared with an anemometer.  The 3-beam method was found to be suitable for use in urban areas.\n",

      "Summary for Flow structure and near-field dispersion in arrays of building-like obstacles: Fig. 10 shows contour plots of the mean concentration at two different heights z=0.23H and z=0.98H for 0° and 45° flow over the aligned array.  As in the 0° flow, the fluctuation intensity I is larger than within the array; it generally decreases with distance from the source, except when the mean concentration C is very small.  Figs. 13-16 show concentration time series and computed statistics at different locations within and just above the aligned array for 0° and 45° flow.  Fig. 16 shows corresponding plots for blocks immediately above the array for the 45° flow.  These near-field dispersion characteristics derive from the underlying flow structure around the buildings, which exerts a strong influence in the near field where there is a higher concentration of material.  This is consistent with the picture that material released at the initial source location moves horizontally into the wake region of adjacent buildings where it is then pushed up by the updraft flow visualised in Section 3.1.3 and then spread by the faster flow above the array.  Having surveyed the structure of the flow field, we now move on to consider its effect on the resulting concentration patterns and dispersion characteristics.  Additionally, we present results for new simulations done for flow at an angle of 45° over a smaller staggered array of domain size 8H x 8H×8H x 8H×8H - see Fig. 1c.  Fig. 4e and f shows the corresponding pattern of streamlines for flow at 45° over the staggered array.  As discussed earlier, the concentration pattern results from the trapping of material into the wake of the building immediately upstream of the source, and the escape of material into the channels on either side, which is then swept downstream in the fast flow in the channel.  Corresponding time series and concentration statistics are shown for the blocks just above the array in Fig. 14.  Secondly, the recirculations trap material and release them on a slower timescale (Vincent, 1978) higher up and into the flow above the array.  Dispersion within a building array is heavily influenced by the flow structure and how it varies in space and time.  This is illustrated here for the 45° aligned array case by looking at lateral profiles of concentration just above the array (at z=1.02H) at different distances from the original source (Fig. 12).\n",
      "Dispersion in the near-field region of localised releases in urban areas is difficult to predict because of the strong influence of individual buildings.  Effects include upstream dispersion, trapping of material into building wakes and enhanced concentration fluctuations.  As a result, concentration patterns are highly variable in time and mean profiles in the near field are strongly non-Gaussian.  These aspects of near-field dispersion are documented by analysing data from direct numerical simulations in arrays of building-like obstacles and are related to the underlying flow structure.  The mean flow structure around the buildings is found to exert a strong influence over the dispersion of material in the near field.  Diverging streamlines around buildings enhance lateral dispersion.  Entrainment of material into building wakes in the very near field gives rise to secondary sources, which then affect the subsequent dispersion pattern.  High levels of concentration fluctuations are also found in this very near field; the fluctuation intensity is of order 2 to 5.  We document key aspects of near-field dispersion in urban areas using DNS data.  We relate these dispersion features to the underlying flow structure.  The effects of wind direction, building layout and source location are examined.  Secondary sources in the near field have a strong effect on the plume spread.  Concentration means and fluctuations are mapped and their magnitudes quantified.\n",

      "Summary for Adaptive resource configuration for Cloud infrastructure management: It demonstrates which actions can be executed in what level to achieve SLA adherence and efficient resource allocation for Cloud infrastructures.  For the rule-based approach we first introduce several resource policy modes to reflect the overall utilization of the system in the VM configuration rules.  Design, Implementation and Evaluation of two KM techniques for one escalation level, i.e., VM resource configuration: CBR, and the rule-based approach.  The goal of the simulation engine is to evaluate the quality of a KM system with respect to the number of SLA violations, the utilization of the resources and the number of required reallocation actions.  Nevertheless, when we relate SLA violations and resource utilization in terms of RAE, all CBR methods are generally better than the default method, especially for α∈{0.3,0.5} after five iterations.  We demonstrate by simulation that the rule-based approach can guarantee the resource requirements in terms of CPU, memory and storage for the execution of the workflow in a resource-efficient way.  The main challenge in this work is to evaluate KM techniques for autonomic SLA enactment in Cloud computing infrastructures that fulfill the three following conflicting goals: (i) achieving low SLA violation rates; (ii) achieving high resource utilization such that the level of allocated but unused resources is as low as possible; and (iii) achieving (i) and (ii) by as few time- and energy-consuming reallocation actions as possible.  However, fewer SLA violations result in lower resource utilization (cf.  A more general approach also taking into account the cost of actions represents the definition of a generic cost function that maps SLA violations, resource wastage and the costs of executed actions into a monetary unit, which we want to call Cloud EUR.  This is possible, because Scenario 2.6 achieves a very good utilization and SLA violation rate with a very low number of reallocation actions.  The subsequent evaluations will be based on the following performance indicators: violations, utilization, actions, resource allocation efficiency (RAE), costs, and time efficiency.  Summarizing, the rule-based approach highly outperforms CBR with respect to violations (up to 82 times better results), actions, cost, and time performance.  Fig. 3 shows the regions and measurements (expressed as utilization of a certain resource) at time steps t1,t2,…,t6.  Our KM system allows us to choose any arbitrary number of resource parameters that can be adjusted on a VM.  As depicted in Fig. 11(a)-(c) one sees violations, utilization, as well as the number of reconfiguration actions, respectively, for every parameter (together with an average value) in the different scenarios.\n",
      "To guarantee the vision of Cloud Computing QoS goals between the Cloud provider and the customer have to be dynamically met.  This so-called Service Level Agreement (SLA) enactment should involve little human-based interaction in order to guarantee the scalability and efficient resource utilization of the system.  To achieve this we start from Autonomic Computing, examine the autonomic control loop and adapt it to govern Cloud Computing infrastructures.  We first hierarchically structure all possible adaptation actions into so-called escalation levels.  We then focus on one of these levels by analyzing monitored data from virtual machines and making decisions on their resource configuration with the help of knowledge management (KM).  The monitored data stems both from synthetically generated workload categorized in different workload volatility classes and from a real-world scenario: scientific workflow applications in bioinformatics.  As KM techniques, we investigate two methods, Case-Based Reasoning and a rule-based approach.  We design and implement both of them and evaluate them with the help of a simulation engine.  Simulation reveals the feasibility of the CBR approach and major improvements by the rule-based approach considering SLA violations, resource utilization, the number of necessary reconfigurations and time performance for both, synthetically generated and real-world data.  ► We apply knowledge management to guarantee SLAs and low resource wastage in Clouds.  ► Escalation levels provide a hierarchical model to structure possible reconfiguration actions.  ► Case-Based Reasoning and rule-based approach prove feasibility as KM techniques.  ► In-depth evaluation of rule-based approach shows major improvements towards CBR.  ► KM is applied to real-world data gathered from scientific bioinformatic workflows.\n",

      "Summary for A memory access model for highly-threaded many-core architectures: Effect of fast local memory size: in some algorithms, including the dynamic programming via matrix multiplication, the size of the fast memory affects the performance of the algorithm in the TMM model.  Section 5 provides the lessons learned from this model; in particular, we see that algorithms that have the same PRAM performance have different performance in the TMM model since they are better at hiding memory latency with fewer threads.  Therefore, if there are enough threads, we should, in principle, be able to use PRAM algorithms on such machines, since we can ignore the effect of memory transfers which is exactly what PRAM model does.  The PRAM model also ignores the vagaries of the memory hierarchy and assumes that each memory access by the algorithm takes unit time.  In particular, we compare these algorithms and find specific relationships between hardware parameters (latency, fast memory size, limits on number of threads) under which some algorithms are better than others even if they have the same PRAM cost.  Among our shortest paths algorithms, only the dynamic programming algorithm makes use of the local memory and the running time depends on this fast memory size.  In this experiment we verify the effect of this fast memory size on algorithm performance.  In addition, for certain problem sizes which fit in local memory, algorithms which are faster on PRAM may be slower under the TMM model.  In particular, it requires the work and depth (like PRAM algorithms), but also requires the analysis of the number of memory accesses.  Since no highly-threaded, many-core machine allows an infinite number of threads, it is important to understand both (1) how many threads does a particular algorithm need to achieve PRAM performance, and (2) how does an algorithm perform when it has fewer threads than required to get PRAM performance?  If the latency of transfers from slow memory to fast memory is small, or if the number of threads per processor is infinite, then this model generally provides the same analysis results as the PRAM analysis.  In this work, we propose the Threaded Many-core Memory (TMM) model that captures the performance characteristics of these highly-threaded, many-core machines.  In the dynamic programming algorithm, we consider the array of size n2 and being able to fit a row into local memory does not reduce the number of memory transfers.  This model explicitly models the large number of threads per processor and the memory latency to slow memory.  The TMM model is a high-level abstract model, meant to be applicable to many instantiations of hardware platforms that feature a large number of threads with fast context switching and a hierarchical memory subsystem of at least two levels with a large memory latency gap in between.  However, from Section 5.2, for a small number of threads/core working on a dense graph, the TMM model predicts that dynamic programming may be better.  In the PRAM model, the algorithm's complexity is analyzed in terms of its work-the time taken by the algorithm on 1 processor, and span (also called depth and critical-path length)-the time taken by the algorithm on an infinite number of processors.\n",
      "A number of highly-threaded, many-core architectures hide memory-access latency by low-overhead context switching among a large number of threads.  The speedup of a program on these machines depends on how well the latency is hidden.  If the number of threads were infinite, theoretically, these machines could provide the performance predicted by the PRAM analysis of these programs.  However, the number of threads per processor is not infinite, and is constrained by both hardware and algorithmic limits.  In this paper, we introduce the Threaded Many-core Memory (TMM) model which is meant to capture the important characteristics of these highly-threaded, many-core machines.  Since we model some important machine parameters of these machines, we expect analysis under this model to provide a more fine-grained and accurate performance prediction than the PRAM analysis.  We analyze 4 algorithms for the classic all pairs shortest paths problem under this model.  We find that even when two algorithms have the same PRAM performance, our model predicts different performance for some settings of machine parameters.  For example, for dense graphs, the dynamic programming algorithm and Johnson's algorithm have the same performance in the PRAM model.  However, our model predicts different performance for large enough memory-access latency and validates the intuition that the dynamic programming algorithm performs better on these machines.  We validate several predictions made by our model using empirical measurements on an instantiation of a highly-threaded, many-core machine, namely the NVIDIA GTX 480.  We design a memory model to analyze algorithms for highly-threaded many-core systems.  The model captures significant factors of performance: work, span, and memory accesses.  We show the model is better than PRAM by applying both to 4 shortest paths algorithms.  Empirical performance is effectively predicted by our model in many circumstances.  It is the first formalized asymptotic model helpful for algorithm design on many-cores.\n",

      "Summary for SpiNNaker: Fault tolerance in a power- and area- constrained large-scale neuromimetic architecture: A network node represents a complete SpiNNaker chip, with all its cores and its router.  As discussed in Section 5, the SpiNNaker system is aware of network failures and can modify its routing tables to avoid conflictive areas.  The basic unit of the system is the SpiNNaker chip (Fig. 4), custom GALS SoC with a network router and 18 cores sharing some resources such as a SRAM, a boot ROM, a System Controller, an Ethernet interface and an 128Mbyte off-chip (but in-package, see Fig. 2) SDRAM.  With a very pessimistic scenario model of a 5-year mean time to failure (MTTF) with sigma of 2 years, the expected number of link failures in a complete SpiNNaker system (65,536 nodes) for any given day (Fday) would lie between 160 and 360.  In extreme failure cases the System Controller can be accessed from a neighbouring SpiNNaker chip using a local debug facility.  A SpiNNaker system communicates with a host computer via Ethernet (Fig. 1) using TCP/IP.  Each SpiNNaker chip performs diagnostics and initialization using minimal system software stored in the Boot ROM.  A system of this scale may be expected to suffer component failures and many features of its design are included to provide a certain degree of fault tolerance.

SpiNNaker is a biologically-inspired massively-parallel computer designed to model up to a billion spiking neurons in real-time.  A full-fledged implementation of a SpiNNaker system will comprise more than 105 integrated circuits (half of which are SDRAMs and half multi-core systems-on-chip).  Given this scale, it is unavoidable that some components fail and, in consequence, fault-tolerance is a foundation of the system design.  Although the target application can tolerate a certain, low level of failures, important efforts have been devoted to incorporate different techniques for fault tolerance.  This paper is devoted to discussing how hardware and software mechanisms collaborate to make SpiNNaker operate properly even in the very likely scenario of component failures and how it can tolerate system-degradation levels well above those expected.\n",

      "Summary for Sink or source-The potential of coffee agroforestry systems to sequester atmospheric CO2 into soil organic carbon: In the Costa Rican experiment reduction in average SOC stocks in 10-40cm depth soil occurred in all shade and management treatments.  Over the whole 0-40cm soil depth there was a decrease in SOC stock during the experiment for three and an increase in two of the shade treatments.  Therefore, over the whole 0-40cm soil depth there was a similar mean decrease in SOC stock between the two pruned and two un-pruned shade types (9.9 and 9.7MgCha-1 respectively); thus the average SOC stock increased across all treatments by 8.5% in the top 10cm of soil and decreased by 21.8% in the 10-40cm depth.  The results of the present study showed that coffee production systems under organic management increased SOC stocks in the top 10cm of soil more than did conventional production systems in Costa Rica (with a highly significant ANOVA test result), but not in Nicaragua.  In Nicaragua no significant differences in changes of SOC stock between the organic and conventional treatments were detected for any soil depth.  In the Nicaraguan experiment the previous land use had been coffee with shade trees and no drainage was carried out, and its reduction in average SOC stock in deeper soil had been much less (only 2.85MgCha-1 at 20-40cm soil depth).  The contrasts within the ANOVA for 0-10cm soil depth SOC stock changes for Costa Rica further support the findings of the mixed effect models, showing a significantly greater increase in SOC stock in the organic than the conventional management treatments (p=0.0001) (Fig. 3).  In both the Nicaraguan and Costa Rican experiments during the first nine years of coffee and tree establishment, SOC stocks in 20-40cm depth soil generally decreased (and this also occurred in 10-20cm depth soil in Costa Rica, giving an average loss over 10-40cm of 12.1MgCha-1).  Across the treatments there were differences in trend of SOC stocks amongst the soil depths in both countries.  In Nicaragua, similar to the results in Costa Rica, in the top 10cm of soil there was an increase in mean SOC stock for every shade treatments (average 1.26MgCha-1 or 2.8%) (Fig. 2 and Table S2).  In fact, we found a nine-year decrease in SOC stocks over 0-40cm depth by an average, across all shade types, of 9.99MgCha-1 (12.4%) in Costa Rica, whereas in Nicaragua (where the long-term land use before the experiment had been the same as afterwards, shaded coffee) there was a much smaller decrease in average 0-40cm depth SOC stock of 0.2MgCha-1 (0.14%).  Especially in the organic systems, which have additional organic matter inputs in the form of manures and coffee pulp, the climate change mitigation potential of the gains in SOC stock in the 0-10cm depth soil equate to an average of 1.45MgCO2eha-1year-1 in Costa Rica and 0.88MgCO2eha-1year-1 in Nicaragua, both of which lie well within the range of estimated non-CO2 GHG emissions from soil resulting from the inputs of organic matter.  This is further supported by the significant differences in SOC stock changes between the treatments with pruned and un-pruned trees in Costa Rica, though all treatments showed a huge contrast in trends of SOC stock with soil depth between an increase at 0-10cm and a decrease at 20-40cm.  In addition, the penetration of roots into the deeper soil, and thereby the deposition of C at that depth (which showed the greatest decrease in SOC stocks) would have been delayed during the establishment of the new trees and coffee bushes.  The specific objectives were to investigate (a) how the addition and management of trees in agricultural systems change total SOC stocks through the soil profile and (b) how agronomic management affects SOC stocks in comparison with the effects of the trees.  In the present study, the plots with initially higher SOC stocks tended to have greater SOC losses (or smaller gains) during the observed period of coffee system establishment, notwithstanding the major difference between them in shade tree and coffee management treatments (Figs.  Specifically, in Costa Rica the change in land-use from long-term arable sugar cane agriculture to an agroforestry system with perennial coffee and shade trees does not lead to an increase in SOC stocks over the first nine years, which is contrary to the widely held expectation (Powlson et al., 2011b).\n",
      "SOC stocks decreased by 12.4% in Costa Rica and 0.13% in Nicaragua after establishment of coffee AFS.  SOC stocks increased in the top 10cm of soil; greater reduction occurred at 20-40cm.  Organic management caused a greater increase in 0-10cm SOC but did not influence reduction at depth.  Shade type effects on SOC were smaller; no significant difference between shaded and unshaded coffee.  SOC stocks tend to converge on a level determined by site environment during establishment.  Current carbon accounting methodologies often assume interactions between above-ground and below-ground carbon, without considering effects of land management.  We used data from two long-term coffee agroforestry experiments in Costa Rica and Nicaragua to assess the effect on total soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks of (i) organic versus conventional management, (ii) higher versus moderate agronomic inputs, (iii) tree shade types.  During the first nine years of coffee establishment total 0-40cm depth SOC stocks decreased by 12.4% in Costa Rica and 0.13% in Nicaragua.  Change in SOC differed consistently amongst soil layers: at 0-10cm SOC stocks increased by 2.14 and 1.26MgCha-1 in Costa Rica and Nicaragua respectively; however much greater reduction occurred at 20-40cm (9.65 and 2.85MgCha-1 respectively).  Organic management caused a greater increase in 0-10cm SOC but did not influence its reduction at depth.  Effects of shade type were smaller, though heavily pruned legume shade trees produced a greater increase in 0-10cm SOC than unpruned timber trees.  No significant differences in SOC stocks were found between shaded and unshaded systems at any depth and SOC was poorly correlated with above-ground biomass stocks highlighting poor validity of \"expansion factors\" currently used to estimate SOC.  SOC stock changes were significantly negatively correlated with initial SOC stock per plot, providing evidence that during establishment of these woody-plant-dominated agricultural systems SOC stocks tend to converge towards a new equilibrium as a function of the change in the quantity and distribution of organic inputs.  Therefore it cannot be assumed that tree-based agricultural systems necessarily lead to increases in soil C stocks.  While high inputs of organic fertiliser/tree pruning mulch increased surface-layer SOC stocks, this did not affect stocks in deeper soil, where decreases generally exceeded any gains in surface soil.  Therefore site- and system-specific sampling is essential to draw meaningful conclusions for climate change mitigation strategies.\n",

      "Summary for Investigating the feasibility of scale up and automation of human induced pluripotent stem cells cultured in aggregates in feeder free conditions: In conclusion, we have successfully demonstrated a protocol passaging hiPSC in an automated system, the CompacT SelecT, with cells maintained as aggregates.  In order to develop an automation process to expand hiPSC using CompacT SelecT, the hiPSC line was transferred to the Centre for Biological Engineering (CBE), Loughborough University where it was further cultured and passaged in T25 flasks using the manual protocol established at LRM (Brons et al., 2007).  The changes made in the four versions of the automated protocol were based on: (a) the time for the colonies to settle down by gravity after washing, (b) the distance of the pipette from the bottom of the flask when removing diluted enzyme solution without aspirating the cells clumps, (c) the pipetting speed and number of mixing steps required to achieve an homogeneous cell suspension of the desirable cell clump size without the presence of an undue number of single cells, and (d) the split ratio (Table 2).  It proved difficult to use the CEDEX cell counter to count clumps of cells in order to passage cells based on cell count as the CEDEX could not count the clumps accurately (data not shown).  Thus this platform can be used to expand and differentiate batches of cells to a tighter specification than manual cell culture (Liu et al., 2010).  For many manual cell culture protocols, there is a centrifugation step to concentrate the cell suspension and allow for cells to be washed.  At Loughborough University, the CompacT SelecT has been successfully used to culture many different cell types including human mesenchymal cells and human embryonic stem cells (hESC) (Thomas et al., 2007, 2009a,b).  Cells were maintained using the manual protocol in both T25 and T175 flasks to show process transfer and scale up within both facilities.  These results suggest that cells expanded with our automation protocol retain the capacity to produce cell types with a clinical interest.\n",

      "Summary for Potential transgenic routes to increase tree biomass: The transgenic plants had increased wood density but the transgene had no effect on the growth phenotype [103].  The best gene combinations for biomass yield will only be revealed by the transgenic line(s) with the best growth under various test conditions.  Under drought stress, the transgenic plants displayed vigorous growth while the wild-type plants shed most of their leaves and produced less root biomass [153] (see Section 9 for a description of these genes).  This gene could be a prime candidate for testing in tree species because there are very few genes that have the potential to double the size of trees.  However, these plants performed poorly from a biomass perspective, so other genes may be more useful for this purpose.  Researchers have demonstrated the effects of manipulating the expression of many plant genes that have significant impact on biomass yield in plants.  The transgenic plants were 30% taller and produced twice as much biomass than the control at a concentration of 300mM NaCl [154].  Significantly, the transgenic plants showed higher sylleptic branching, a trait associated with high biomass yield in poplar [5].  Transgenic poplar over-expressing both chit1 and AMP2 were significantly more resistant to A. alternata than single gene transformants and wild-type trees [177].  Hence, it is prudent to generate transgenic trees that have an array of resistance genes for use against known pests.  Over-expression of this gene may be useful in generating high-yielding and drought-resistant poplar and other tree species [59].  Table 7 contains a list of genes that have endowed plants with resistance to biotic adversaries.  As discussed in Section 2.1.2, over-expression of this gene in hybrid poplar (P. tremula×P. alba) produced semi-dwarf trees.  A major advantage of Agrobacterium-mediated transgenesis using binary vectors containing multi-effector gene cassettes is that it will generally result in transgenic plants with the same set of genes.\n",
      "Increasing forest biomass has significant economic and environmental impact.  Many forestry objectives, e.g., more biomass, are best attained by transgenesis.  Transgenes enable plants to display one or a few traits for biomass applications.  Multi-trait engineering can generate a superior tree expressing most desired traits.  Biomass is a prime target for genetic engineering in forestry because increased biomass yield will benefit most downstream applications such as timber, fiber, pulp, paper, and bioenergy production.  Transgenesis can increase biomass by improving resource acquisition and product utilization and by enhancing competitive ability for solar energy, water, and mineral nutrients.  Transgenes that affect juvenility, winter dormancy, and flowering have been shown to influence biomass as well.  Transgenic approaches have increased yield potential by mitigating the adverse effects of prevailing stress factors in the environment.  Simultaneous introduction of multiple genes for resistance to various stress factors into trees may help forest trees cope with multiple or changing environments.  We propose multi-trait engineering for tree crops, simultaneously deploying multiple independent genes to address a set of genetically uncorrelated traits that are important for crop improvement.  This strategy increases the probability of unpredictable (synergistic or detrimental) interactions that may substantially affect the overall phenotype and its long-term performance.  The very limited ability to predict the physiological processes that may be impacted by such a strategy requires vigilance and care during implementation.  Hence, we recommend close monitoring of the resultant transgenic genotypes in multi-year, multi-location field trials.\n",

      "Summary for Surface roughness reduction using spray-coated hydrogen silsesquioxane reflow: Neither the HSQ film thickness nor the surface topography/roughness can be reliably measured without metallization.  In conclusion, we have been able to show that a relatively thin HSQ film on metallic substrates such as molds for injection molding is able to greatly to decrease surface roughness.  For the 3-D optical profiler measurements on surfaces coated with the cured HSQ films it was necessary to sputter a thin layer of a reflective film in order to characterize roughness of HSQ coated surfaces.  Samples that have been spray-coated with HSQ and cured show considerably reduced roughness as shown in Fig. 1.  This finally allows surface topography measurement on HSQ coated substrates using a 3-D optical profilometer, as shown in Fig. 4.  A soft HSQ film reflows to achieve the minimal surface area.  To increase reflectance of the HSQ film and to avoid light transmission and reflection from the metal substrate, we sputter coated cured HSQ samples with a thin film of gold/palladium (80/20) alloy.  The bottom row shows profiles of same surfaces coated with a cured HSQ film.  We can also directly see a low roughness top surface, with islands and voids of metal from a deposition of a reflective film.  Hence, HSQ only reflects approximately 2.4-2.7% of incident light, assuming perpendicular incidence and no roughness.  Half of sample area was masked with cleanroom blue tape, and therefore not coated with HSQ.  Therefore we sputtered thin reflective films not only on HSQ coated samples but also on silicon wafer samples, to verify the topography change due to the sputtering of a reflective film.  We see substantial decrease of roughness on the HSQ coated samples; approximately 10 times for a sample with initially higher roughness and 3 times for a sample with initially lower roughness.  This, together with an uneven, rough and highly reflective metallic substrate surface under the HSQ prevents reliable optical characterization without metallization.  With a known tilt angle and scale we can calculate The HSQ film thickness of approximately 1.3μm for selected spray parameters.\n",
      "Spray-coated silsesquioxane coating can be applied to planar and non-planar surfaces.  Cured coating sustains in excess of 10,000 molding cycles.  The peak-to-valley roughness is decreased 10 to 20 times.  Good agreement between mechanical (AFM) and optical (VSI) methods.  Surface roughness or texture is the most visible property of any object, including injection molded plastic parts.  Roughness of the injection molding (IM) tool cavity directly affects not only appearance and perception of quality, but often also the function of all manufactured plastic parts.  So called \"optically smooth\" plastic surfaces is one example, where low roughness of a tool cavity is desirable.  Such tool surfaces can be very expensive to fabricate using conventional means, such as abrasive diamond polishing or diamond turning.  We present a novel process to coat machined metal parts with hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) to reduce their surface roughness.  Results from the testing of surfaces made from two starting roughnesses are presented; one polished with grit 2500 sandpaper, another with grit 11.000 diamond polishing paste.  We characterize the two surfaces with AFM, SEM and optical profilometry before and after coating.  We show that the HSQ coating is able to reduce peak-to-valley roughness more than 20 times on the sandpaper polished sample, from 2.44(±0.99)μm to 104(±22)nm and more than 10 times for the paste polished sample from 1.85(±0.63)μm to 162(±28)nm while roughness averages are reduced 10 and 3 times respectively.  We completed more than 10,000 injection molding cycles without detectable degradation of the HSQ coating.  This result opens new possibilities for molding of affordable plastic parts with perfect surface finish.\n",

      "Summary for Rhizosphere acid and alkaline phosphatase activity as a marker of P nutrition in nodulated Cyclopia and Aspalathus species in the Cape fynbos of South Africa: In conclusion, our results suggest that acid/alkaline phosphatase activity in the rhizosphere of Cyclopia and Aspalathus species growing in the low-P soils of the Cape fynbos can be used as a predictor of P supply and P assimilation in the rhizosphere of those legumes.  While these high P concentrations in shoots of Cyclopia species could be attributed to P enzyme activity in the rhizosphere, it is well documented that N2-fixing legumes generally accumulate greater mineral nutrients in their organs than cereals (Broadley et al., 2003; Fageria, 2004; Pedersen et al., 2002).  The data showed that acid phosphatase activity was again higher in the rhizosphere soils of C. subternata compared to bulk soil (Table 3).  Using an agricultural legume, Makoi et al (2010) reported significant correlations between plant-available P and acid phosphatase activity in the rhizosphere of cowpea grown in fynbos soils.  A 1-Way ANOVA was performed to compare the means of phosphatase enzyme activity as well as P concentration in soil and shoots of each species.  The greater acid/alkaline phosphatase activity also resulted in changes in soil organic P. As the activity of soil phosphatases increased (Table 2), there was a marked and significant decrease in rhizosphere organic P compared to the bulk soil, and a decrease in rhizosphere organic P of older plants compared to their younger counterparts (Table 2).  Is the expression of acid/alkaline phosphatase activity different in the rhizosphere of cuttings and seedlings of Cyclopia species?  Can acid/alkaline phosphatase activity in the rhizosphere serve as an indicator of P supply to Cyclopia species?  Although the rhizosphere pΗ of each species was generally lower than that of the corresponding bulk soil, these were not statistically significant.  The mean values of rhizosphere and bulk soil were respectively 4.32 and 4.48, 4.12 and 4.48, and 4.12 and 4.20 for Cyclopia genistoides, Aspalathus species and Cyclopia subternata.  As described before, this was done using bioassays of P enzyme activity in rhizosphere soils, as well as P in shoots of tea plants.  In this study, we also found a significantly positive correlation between acid phosphatase activity and organic P levels in the rhizosphere of the test legumes (Table 5).  Rhizosphere soil of C. subternata established in 1999 showed significantly greater acid and alkaline phosphatase activity to that grown in 2002 (Table 3).  Although the rhizosphere soil of Aspalathus caledonensis had the second highest P enzyme activity, rhizosphere Pi was lowest for that species (Fig. 1B).\n",
      "Cyclopia and Aspalathus species are important economic legumes in the Cape fynbos of South Africa, as they are used for making Honeybush and Rooibos tea, and for trade in the cut wild flower industry.  The aim of this study was to assess acid and alkaline phosphatase activity in the rhizosphere of Cyclopia genistoides, Cyclopia subternata, Aspalathus caledonensis and Aspalathus aspalathoides as an indicator of P supply and P nutrition in the nutrient-poor soils of the Cape fynbos.  Whether at Kokrivier or Kanetberg, the P enzyme activities were much higher in the rhizospheres of the legumes C. genistoides, C. subternata, A. caledonensis, and A. aspalathoides compared to those of the non-legumes Leucadendron strictum, Elegia thyrsoidea and Mimetes cucullatus, or bulk soil.  As a result, plant-available P concentration in the rhizosphere, as well as shoot P levels closely mirrored acid and alkaline phosphatase activity in the rhizosphere of each plant species.  Relative to younger plants, older Cyclopia species exhibited, much greater acid and alkaline phosphatase activity in the rhizosphere and this again resulted in much higher plant-available rhizosphere P. C. subternata plants developed from cuttings at Kanetberg showed greater rhizosphere acid and alkaline phosphatase activity than seedlings and bulk soil.  As a result, the concentration of plant available-P and organic P were much higher in the rhizosphere of cuttings than seedlings, leading to greater shoot P in cuttings than seedlings.  Taken together, these data suggest that rhizosphere P enzyme activity can be used as a good indicator of P supply and P nutrition in Cyclopia cuttings and seedlings, but less so in Aspalathus species in the Cape fynbos.  The enhanced P nutrition in plants from cuttings probably accounts for the higher tea yields obtained by farmers when they use cuttings instead of seedlings in their plantations.  We measured acid and alkaline phosphatase activity in rhizosphere soils relative to bulk soils of fynbos legumes.  We concurrently measured P levels in rhizosphere and shoots.  We found significantly higher acid/alkaline phosphatase activity in rhizosphere soils relative to non-rhizosphere bulk soils.  Acid and alkaline activity increased with age of Cyclopia plants.  Plants developed from cuttings increased acid/alkaline phosphatase activity over seedlings.\n",

      "Summary for Preparation and characterization of a dual-layer carbon film on 6H-SiC wafer using carbide-derived carbon process with subsequent chemical vapor deposition: Fig. 4 shows the AFM images and corresponding 3D profiles of SiC wafer, CDC layer and dual-layer film, indicating surface morphology evolution in the process.  The XPS measurements were carried out aiming to determine the surface composition and chemical nature for SiC, CDC layer and dual-layer film, as demonstrated in Fig. 3.  Surface analysis of the CDC layer reveals that it does not consist purely of carbon, but that it still contains O, Si and Cl components.  Fig. 2 presents the Raman spectra of SiC substrate, CDC layer, and dual-layer film to investigate the structure evolvement.  The surface microstructures of the CDC layer and the dual-layer film are also investigated by FESEM as shown in Fig. 5.  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to analyze the surface composition and chemical nature of the CDC layer and the dual-layer film.  The surface of SiC was converted into CDC and the shape of the sample stayed unchanged, as demonstrated in Fig. 1.  Differently, the friction coefficients of the CDC layer and the dual-layer film against steel ball are higher than Si3N4.  As a result, the dual-layer carbon film composed of sub-layer of CDC and top layer of CVD carbon was synthesized.  Compared with CVD process, the CDC process can easily produce a thick carbon layer (above 100um) at a high rate [6,7].  The dual-layer film is composed of a CDC layer formed by chlorination of SiC and a CVD layer formed by pyrolyzing the CCl4 at high temperature.  However, the effect of surface chemical nature of CDC layer under the top layer cannot be studied by XPS.  The surface atomic concentration of Cl in the CDC layer by XPS analysis is about 5.5at.%.\n",
      "It is reported that a dual-layer carbon film on SiC wafer is prepared using carbide-derived carbon (CDC) process with subsequent chemical vapor deposition (CVD).  The dual-layer film includes a sub-layer of CDC and a top layer of CVD, which are prepared by chlorination of SiC and pyrolysis of CCl4 at high temperature respectively.  The CDC and CVD layers are mainly amorphous.  And similar dispersion effects are observed in the Raman spectra, although the D-band position of the CVD layer shifts to higher wavenumber (~1354cm-1) than that of the CDC layer (~1337cm-1).  Surface chemistry analysis suggests that the unstable chemical bonds, mainly C-Cl, as well as dangling bonds in the CDC layer play an important role in promoting the nucleation of CVD carbon.  The surface morphology evolvement from SiC wafer to CDC layer and to dual-layer film is investigated by atomic force microscopy [AFM] and field emission scanning electronic microscopy [FESEM].  The nanoporous surface formed in the CDC process is favorable for capturing carbon species from the gas phase and can act as a \"seedbed\" for the nucleation and growth of CVD layer.  The primary tribological study indicates that the dual-layer film shows great advantages in friction reduction and wear resistance with comparison to SiC and CDC layer, suggesting its potential in lubrication for SiC-based moving components.  The dual-layer carbon film is prepared using CDC process with subsequent CVD method.  The surface of the CDC layer is highly porous in structure and chemically active.  The CDC layer acts as a seedbed layer for the nucleation and growth of the CVD layer.  The dual-layer film is tested as an effective lubricating coating for SiC components.\n",

      "Summary for Effect of glyphosate on Macrophomina phaseolina in vitro and its effect on disease severity of soybean in the field: The estimates of CFU of M. phaseolina following glyphosate treatment at each location are shown in Fig. 3.  The reason as to why the CFU levels were reduced at V3 and V6 rather than when applied twice at V3 and V6 in MS indicates that multiple applications of glyphosate may result in soybean injury and inhibition of soybean nodules causing stress to the crop (Reddy and Zablotowicz, 2003).  This study reports the effect of glyphosate on M. phaseolina in vitro and the effect of glyphosate on the population dynamics of M. phaseolina (colony forming units) collected from infected soybean in the field.  This is in agreement with the finding of Mengistu et al. (2008) that colony forming units in soybean tissue were greater under conventional tillage than under no-till when two applications of glyphosate at 0.84 kg a.i/ha were applied.  It has been established that the optimal temperature for M. phaseolina growth in culture is 30 °C (Mengistu et al., 2007).  To test if glyphosate has any effect on M. phaseolina, it is necessary to conduct both in vitro and field studies.  The figure highlights the wide-range of CFU measurements across glyphosate applications and environments.  The radial growth with Gly-K salt showed little variation at various glyphosate concentrations and temperatures in comparison to GlyCry.  The reduced CFU level from single applications may also be caused by indirect rather than by direct effect of glyphosate.  glycines (Sanogo et al., 2000) with increasing concentrations of glyphosate herbicide (Kawate et al., 1992).  When relating the glyphosate tested in vitro to what was used in the field, the concentrations of glyphosate required for inhibition are well beyond what would be applied under field conditions.  The lower CFU values in TN may be due to soybean planting in no-till as opposed to planting in tilled soil as in MS.  As a result, there is limited knowledge whether single or sequential applications of glyphosate in the field affect charcoal rot severity.\n",
      "Laboratory and field studies were conducted to assess the effects of glyphosate on Macrophomina phaseolina culture growth in vitro and the disease severity of charcoal rot in soybean fields at Stoneville, MS and Jackson, TN.  Glyphosate inhibited M. phaseolina growth in a linear dose dependent manner when technical grade glyphosate acid (GlyCry) was used; however, growth was inhibited in an exponential dose dependent manner when a commercial formulation of glyphosate-potassium salt (Gly-K salt) was used.  The glyphosate GR50 values (glyphosate concentration required to cause a 50% reduction) in culture radial growth ranged from 0.25 to 9.94 mM among the M. Phaseolina isolates, temperatures, and formulations.  The three isolates differed in response to various concentrations across the three temperature regimes.  Among the three isolates, TN 410 was the most sensitive for both GlyCry (GR50 = 7.74 mM) and Gly-K salt (GR50 = 0.25 mM) at 30 °C.  This research indicates that glyphosate has the ability to inhibit growth of M. phaseolina in culture in vitro.  The preliminary field studies demonstrated that application of glyphosate to glyphosate-resistant soybeans did not enhance or reduce the severity of charcoal rot in a no-till field in TN but had some suppressing effect in a tilled environment in MS when single applications were made at growth stage V3 and V6.  Glyphosate effect on growth of Macrophomina phaseolina in culture and severity was assessed.  Glyphosate inhibited M. phaseolina in vitro.  Sensitivity to glyphosate concentrations differed between isolates.  Disease severity was not affected by Glyphosate application of no-till field.  Glyphosate had suppressing effect in tilled field under hot and dry conditions.\n",

      "Summary for Late Quaternary tephrostratigraphy of southern Chile and Argentina: The SVZ has produced some of the largest explosive eruptions in recent history, most notably the 1932 Quizapu (Cerro Azul; M 6.0, >9.5 km3 tephra; Hildreth and Drake, 1992) and 1991 Cerro Hudson (M 5.8, 4-7 km3 tephra; Naranjo et al., 1993a) eruptions.  Some care is required to distinguish peaks in cryptotephra concentration representing primary fallout from those reflecting tephra remobilisation (Swindles et al., 2013), which is possible even in distal locations, where the tephra can be sourced from erosion of the peat bogs themselves (e.g., Swindles et al., 2013).  Amigo et al. (2013) found that this tephra in the cores of ODP Site 1233 consists of two populations of shards, rhyodacitic and basaltic andesitic, but could not identify a source volcano for this tephra.  Even larger eruptions are known to have occurred in the SVZ during the Pleistocene (e.g., the Diamante caldera-forming event, Maipo; M 7.7, ∼270-350 km3 tephra: Sruoga et al., 2005; Stern et al., 1984b).  Surface accumulations of tephra are therefore almost exclusively preserved thanks to the presence of vegetation in or near the Andes, where tephra accumulation has only been possible since the time at which the ice sheet last retreated from the location (e.g., Menounos et al., 2013).  Chemical alteration is a particularly significant issue with tephra preservation in peat bogs, cores or sections through which are the most common source of tephra samples in southernmost Patagonia/from the AVZ (Supplementary Table 2; Stern, 2008).  However, the compilation of tephra records in palaeoenvironmental archives of southern Chile and Argentina (Supplementary Table 2) shows that the vast majority of tephra layers are insufficiently characterised to allow the source to be identified.  Appropriate tephra characterisation can potentially also help in evaluating the reservoir effect in a sediment section by providing a tie-point in the age model, provided the age of the tephra is well known from one or more independent sources (e.g., 14C dating on charcoal incorporated in terrestrial deposits, for example the well-constrained 3.00-3.05 ka cal BP Alpehué Pumice (So-A) eruption from Sollipulli; Supplementary Table 1; Naranjo et al., 1993b).  However, correlations sometimes only rely on a rough age correspondence between distinctive tephra layers in different sections (e.g., Abarzúa et al., 2004; Lamy et al., 2004).  In these cases, the distal deposits could indeed consist of several populations of chemically distinct particles, as seen for the Nahuel Huapi Tephra (Villarosa et al., 2006), corresponding to a ca 2.2-2.8 ka cal BP dacitic pumice fall overlain by basaltic andesitic scoria from the Antillanca Group (Supplementary Table 1; Singer et al., 2008).  The age of the oldest post-glacial tephra units reported here (in Supplementary Table 1) generally decreases with increasing latitude, reflecting the timing of ice retreat, as previously noted for part of the SVZ by Watt et al. (2013a).  Few tephra units from the SVZ and AVZ have been reported in the sparse offshore sediment cores from the region (Supplementary Table 2): this is perhaps in part due to a lack of recognition rather than absence, but also because with the prevailing westerly winds, deposition of macrotephra (visible tephra) layers in either the Pacific or Atlantic is unlikely except during the largest of eruptions.  For example, most visible tephra layers found in short cores in the Villarrica and Calafquén lakes originate from VEI/M 2 eruptions of nearby Villarrica volcano, and are difficult to characterise chemically due to an abundance of microphenocrysts and non-distinct chemical compositions (Van Daele et al., in press).  From the tephra dispersal patterns presented in Fig. 2 it is clear that tephra from the majority of the large eruptions is dispersed eastward.\n",
      "The Southern and Austral Volcanic Zones of the Andes comprise 74 volcanic centres with known post-glacial activity.  At least 21 of these have had one or more large explosive eruptions in the late Quaternary, dispersing tephra over vast areas.  These tephra layers therefore have great potential as tephrochronological marker horizons in palaeoenvironmental studies in southern Chile and Argentina, a region that is particularly useful to study climate dynamics of the southern hemisphere.  However, to date tephrochronology has rarely been fully utilised in this region as a correlation and dating tool.  Here we review the existing post-glacial tephrostratigraphic record of the Southern and Austral Volcanic Zones, and compile a database of known occurrences of tephra from these volcanoes in ice and lacustrine, marine, peat, and cave sediment records.  We address the inconsistencies in and revisions of the tephrostratigraphies presented in prior literature, and discuss the challenges in correlating tephras and the limitations of the tephrostratigraphic record in this area.  This study highlights the many gaps that still exist in our knowledge of the eruptive histories of these volcanoes, but also reveals the largely under-utilised potential of tephra as a correlation tool in this region.  This is exemplified by the severe lack of adequate geochemical analysis of tephra layers preserved in many lacustrine and peat sediment sections, which are particularly important tephrostratigraphic records in southern Chile and Argentina due to the paucity of surface preservation.  Review of the post-glacial tephrostratigraphy in southern Chile/Argentina.  Identify 29 potential regional marker tephra units from 21 volcanoes.  Present database of tephra occurrences in palaeoenvironment records from the region.  Describe challenges in correlation of tephra units in the region.  The tephrochronological potential of sediment sections is significantly underused.\n",

      "Summary for Inelastic neutron scattering study of binding of para-hydrogen in an ultra-microporous metal-organic framework: Upon loading with H2 (0.25 H2/Al and 0.50 H2/Al) at 40-50K, the background of the INS spectra increases due to the recoil of the H2 molecules, and a broad hump is observed at low energy transfers (<30meV) confirming uptake of H2 by NOTT-300 (Fig. 3(b)).  The peak at 8.8meV in the spectra for NOTT-300·nH2 (n=0.5,1.0) in this study is entirely consistent with the INS peak (10meV) observed for MOF-5, confirming that the adsorbed H2 molecules in NOTT-300 are interacting with [Al(OH)2O4] moieties (Fig. 4).  We report herein the application of the in situ inelastic neutron scattering (INS) technique to permit direct observation of the dynamics of the binding interactions between adsorbed H2 molecules and an aluminium-based porous MOF, NOTT-300, exhibiting moderate porosity, narrow pore window and very low uptake of H2.  Thus, comparison of the INS spectra suggests that adsorbed H2 molecules have very weak interactions to the NOTT-300 host and, therefore, can rotate freely in the channel to give recoil rotational motion.  Interestingly, the very low H2 adsorption has been successfully characterised as weak binding interactions and, for the first time, we have found that the adsorbed H2 in the pore channel has a liquid type recoil motion at 5K (below its melting point) as a direct result of this weak interaction to the MOF host.  Direct visualisation of the interaction between adsorbed H2 molecules and the NOTT-300 host is crucial to understanding the detailed mechanism of interaction and hence rationalising the unusually low observed uptake capacity.\n",
      "Metal-organic framework (MOF) materials show promise for H2 storage and it is widely predicted by computational modelling that MOFs incorporating ultra-micropores are optimal for H2 binding due to enhanced overlapping potentials.  We report the investigation using inelastic neutron scattering of the interaction of H2 in an ultra-microporous MOF material showing low H2 uptake capacity.  The study has revealed that adsorbed H2 at 5K has a liquid recoil motion along the channel with very little interaction with the MOF host, consistent with the observed low uptake.  The low H2 uptake is not due to incomplete activation or decomposition as the desolvated MOF shows CO2 uptake with a measured pore volume close to that of the single crystal pore volume.  This study represents a unique example of surprisingly low H2 uptake within a MOF material, and complements the wide range of studies on systems showing higher uptake capacities and binding interactions.\n",

      "Summary for Efficient sets are small: By Lemma 1.2, the translation of an efficient set is efficient; by Theorem 3.4 the translation (a degenerate bi-Lipschitz map) leaves unchanged the set's Hausdorff dimension.  Thus, Jordan's conjecture can be settled if the elements identified by the theorem can be bounded: the isolated allocations, as countable sets, have measure and dimension zero; Theorems 2.1 and 3.2 bound the indifferent allocations; the balance of power loci have not yet been bounded.  Our main result is that the Hausdorff dimension of any efficient set in Rp is no more than p-1.  Thus, since Hausdorff, showing that a set has Lebesgue measure zero has simply raised a more basic problem, namely that of finding the appropriate dimension in which to then measure the set.  As argued in the Introduction, finding that a set has Lebesgue measure zero for finite p is a challenge to find the correct dimension in which to measure the set.  Hausdorff noted that a measure zero result indicated that the right dimension for measurement had yet to be found, and defined a set of measures for real rather than just integer dimensions.  Any internally stable set,S, is a subset of the union of a finite number of each of: balance of power loci, isolated allocations, and allocations over which all agents are indifferent.  Section 2 proves that efficient sets in Rp have p-dimensional Lebesgue measure zero.\n",
      "We introduce efficient sets, a class of sets in Rp in which, in each set, no element is greater in all dimensions than any other.  Neither differentiability nor continuity is required of such sets, which include: level sets of utility functions, quasi-indifference classes associated with a preference relation not given by a utility function, mean-variance frontiers, production possibility frontiers, and Pareto efficient sets.  By Lebesgue's density theorem, efficient sets have p-dimensional measure zero.  As Lebesgue measure provides an imprecise description of small sets, we then prove the stronger result that each efficient set in Rp has Hausdorff dimension at most p-1.  This may exceed its topological dimension, with the two notions becoming equivalent for smooth sets.  We apply these results to stable sets in multi-good pillage games: for n agents and m goods, stable sets have dimension at most m(n-1)-1.  This implies, and is much stronger than, the result that stable sets have m(n-1)-dimensional measure zero, as conjectured by Jordan.\n",

      "Summary for The intake of inorganic arsenic from long grain rice and rice-based baby food in Finland - Low safety margin warrants follow up: We validated and accredited the arsenic speciation method for rice.  The arsenic species detected in the rice samples were DMA, As(III) and As(V).  Some assessments of the inorganic arsenic intake from long grain rice and baby food can be made (Table 4).  The total arsenic content of long grain rice samples analysed in this study varied from 0.11 to 0.65mg/kg (n=8) and the average amount of total arsenic in long grain rice samples was 0.25mg/kg (Table 2).  In this article we describe a fully validated method for the determination of total and inorganic arsenic in rice.  The total arsenic content of rice based baby food products was 0.09mg/kg on average (n=10), ranging from 0.02 to 0.29mg/kg (Table 3) and arsenic species in rice based baby foods were the same as in long grain rice (DMA, As(III), As(V)).  In this category, rice is one of the main contributors to the inorganic arsenic intake due to its high level of total arsenic.  We also assessed total and inorganic arsenic levels in long grain rice and rice-based baby food products on the Finnish market.  No certified reference materials are available for inorganic arsenic species of rice.  However, with respect to arsenic intake the way of cooking significantly contributes to the arsenic intake originating from rice (Mihucz et al., 2007).  Therefore it is possible to recommend that there should be \"dilution\" of the rice powder with some other healthy ingredient low in its inorganic arsenic level to lower the overall arsenic intake.  In general the total and inorganic arsenic contents of rice-based baby food are lower than the levels in long grain rice.\n",
      "Inorganic arsenic was determined in long grain rice and rice-based baby food samples.  The inorganic arsenic intake from one source is close to the lowest BMDL0.1 value.  The cumulative intake assessment of inorganic arsenic is needed.  We evaluated total and inorganic arsenic levels in long grain rice and rice based baby foods on Finnish market.  Inorganic arsenic was analysed with an HPLC-ICP-MS system.  The total arsenic concentration was determined with an ICP-MS method.  In this study, the inorganic arsenic levels in long grain rice varied from 0.09 to 0.28mg/kg (n=8) and the total arsenic levels from 0.11 to 0.65mg/kg.  There was a good correlation between the total and inorganic arsenic levels in long grain rice at a confidence level of 95%.  The total arsenic levels of rice-based baby foods were in the range 0.02 - 0.29mg/kg (n=10), however, the level of inorganic arsenic could only be quantitated in four samples, on average they were 0.11mg/kg.  Our estimation of inorganic arsenic intake from long grain rice and rice-based baby food in Finland indicate that in every age group the intake is close to the lowest BMDL0.1 value 0.3μg/kg bw/day set by EFSA.  According to our data, the intake of inorganic arsenic should be more extensively evaluated.\n",

      "Summary for Regeneration of native broadleaved species on clearfelled conifer plantations in upland Britain: We have explored the regeneration density of native broadleaved species on clearfelled conifer sites in upland Britain.  Whilst the regeneration of holly and oak were recorded infrequently (<20% of sites), relatively high regeneration densities were recorded at specific sites for these species (for example, 723stems/ha in the case of oak).  The diversity of regenerating species was usually lower than that of the adjacent seed sources with regeneration dominated by birch on all but one clearfelled site, as has been found previously at storm damaged lowland sites in Britain (Harmer and Morgan, 2009; Harmer et al., 2011) and elsewhere in Europe (Degen et al., 2005).  The mean density of regeneration of native species on clearfelled sites varied from 0stems/ha to >5000stems/ha (Table 2).  Table 3 shows the density of regeneration for native species and the fraction of clearfelled sites where each species was recorded.  We found natural regeneration was mostly of shade-intolerant pioneer species and was dominated by birch.  However, the regeneration of native species on clearfelled conifer plantations is still poorly understood (Zerbe, 2002) with Wallace (1998)'s study of birch regeneration in clearfelled spruce plantations the only previous study in upland Britain.  The density of birch regeneration on clearfelled upland moorland on our study sites is similar to that recorded in a storm damaged lowland conifer site in Britain (Harmer and Morgan, 2009) and to clearfelled upland conifer sites in Scotland (Wallace, 1998).  The linear regression of time since clearfelling on regeneration density of native species was not found to be significant (r2=0.26, n.s.).  While the regeneration density of non-native tree species is shown in Table 2 it is important to note that in a number of study sites regenerating non-native conifers had been felled, making it difficult to draw any conclusions about the frequency of non-native regeneration.  Nevertheless, the regeneration density on clearfelled upland moorland sites and a clearfelled PAWS site (5790stems/ha) exceeded the suggested sapling stocking densities for new native woodland in Britain of between 500 and 2000stems/ha (Forestry Commission, 2010).  We addressed the following questions: (i) How well do native tree species regenerate on clearfelled upland conifer plantations? (ii) How does regeneration on clearfelled conifer plantations compare to regeneration on improved farmland and open moorland? (iii) What are the dominant factors controlling regeneration? (iv) How does the ground flora develop in the years following clearfelling and how does this impact tree regeneration?  Here we report the first extensive study of natural regeneration of native hardwood species on clearfelled upland conifer plantations in Britain.  No significant relationship between plant cover and regeneration density was seen for any species.\n",
      "We examine native tree regeneration on clearfelled conifer plantations.  Mean regeneration density exceeded 1000stems/ha and was dominated by birch.  Regeneration is increased by the absence of ground flora after clearfelling.  Proximity to a wind-dispersed seed source increased natural regeneration.  Brash piles reduced regeneration density.  In upland areas of Great Britain, large tracts of non-native conifer plantations have been established on poor quality agricultural land.  There is now considerable interest in the conversion of some of these plantations to a more natural woodland comprised of native tree species.  We studied the tree regeneration and ground flora on 15 upland sites (altitudes ranging from 120m to 380m above sea level) that had been clearfelled of conifers.  Regeneration of native tree species was successful where a clearcut site was adjacent to mature native trees, which acted as a seed source.  Mean regeneration densities of native tree species on clearcut sites were typically greater than 1000stems/ha, exceeding minimum recommended planting densities for the establishment of new native woodland.  Whilst 10 native woody tree species were recorded, the regeneration was dominated by birch species.  Regeneration densities were significantly higher on clearcut sites than on adjacent areas of unplanted moorland, probably due to the lack of a dense ground flora following the clearfelling operations.  Our results indicate that where local native seed sources exist, clearfelling upland conifer plantation sites to allow natural regeneration has the potential to be an effective method of establishing native woodland.\n",

      "Summary for Experimental study of bore-driven swash hydrodynamics on impermeable rough slopes: For example, at the time of maximum backwash velocity on the 1.3mm sand-rough beach at x=0.772m, the velocity increases from zero at the bed to -1.8m/s at the surface within a depth of 25mm.  The measurements for the location seaward of the beach, x=-1.802m, echo the depth measurements for the same location (Fig. 9): for all 3 beaches the u¯ time-series are nearly identical for the majority of the uprush period and are similar during the backwash, with u¯ time series for the 1.3mm sand-rough beach lagging slightly behind the other two.  (For reference, friction factors calculated assuming steady and uniform flow and evaluated from the measured depths and velocities, with equivalent roughness of 1.3mm and 8.4mm, are consistently higher for the rougher beach by approximately 50%.) The fact that the friction factors are not very different in the present experiments suggests that the high flow unsteadiness and non-uniformity of swash have significant influence on the bed shear stress for a given instantaneous velocity.  Maximum swash flow depth decreases with increasing distance from the initial shoreline, which means that a smaller flow area needs to be measured for locations further up the beach slope, with consequent increase in accuracy of the velocity measurement.  For example, for the 1.3mm sand-rough beach measurements were possible down to 1mm flow depth.  There is very little variability in the depth-averaged velocity results up to the time of maximum backwash velocity, after which the relatively small flow depths and high velocities cause high levels of bed-generated turbulence throughout the flow column.  But we note that previous laboratory results for cf are not based on simultaneous measurements of shear stress and velocity profile, as they are here, while the method used in the field to obtain uprush and backwash velocities only allowed estimates for the friction factor during the time of bore arrival and late in the backwash.  The longer time gap between the time of bore arrival and the first velocity measurement explains why maximum uprush velocity at x=0.072m appears to be lower than the maximum uprush velocity at locations higher up the beach.  The flow accelerates in the backwash until it reaches a maximum backwash velocity when the retarding force due to bed friction balances the driving force due to the slope component of weight of water on the beach.  At the lower end of the beach, friction factors during late uprush are higher than those for the corresponding steady uniform flow values; for all locations on the beach, friction factors during early backwash are lower than the corresponding steady uniform flow values.  Fig. 11 also shows the times of flow reversal (based on the ensemble-averaged depth-averaged velocity time-series, Fig. 12) at the five PIV measurement locations on the beach.  It seems that location on the beach and whether the flow is accelerating or decelerating have significant effect on the bed shear stress.\n",
      "A detailed experimental investigation of the hydrodynamics of large-scale, bore-driven swash on impermeable, rough beach slopes is described.  The experiments were carried out on 1:10 impermeable, rough slopes with three different surface roughnesses based on 1.3mm sand, 5.4mm gravel and 8.4mm gravel.  The large-scale discrete swash event was produced by the collapse of a dambreak-generated bore on the beach.  Simultaneous depths and velocities were measured using LIF, Laser-induced fluorescence, and PIV, particle image velocimetry, respectively, yielding better resolution of the hydrodynamics than previous studies.  Depth time-series, instantaneous velocity profiles, depth-averaged velocities, instantaneous turbulent kinetic energy profiles, depth-averaged turbulent kinetic energy, Reynolds stress profiles and bed shear stresses are presented for five cross-shore measurement locations in the swash.  The measurements resolve the backwash shoreline position, and the late backwash period when depths are shallow and velocities are high.  The detailed data can be used to test and develop advanced numerical models for bore-driven waves on rough slopes.  ►Detailed hydrodynamics of bore-driven swash on impermeable, rough slopes.  ►Large-scale laboratory experiments measuring simultaneous depths and velocities.  ►Shows effects of slope roughness on bulk flow and turbulence properties.  ►Yields measures of time-varying bed shear stress across the swash zone.\n",

      "Summary for Numerical model of swash motion and air entrapment within coarse-grained beaches: Bore-driven swash on unsaturated coarse-grained beaches generates several interacting physical processes: surface flow over the beach face, infiltration into the initially unsaturated part of the beach, air entrapment below the wetting front (Steenhauer et al., 2011a) and groundwater flow.  Furthermore, air entrapment between the wetting front and the groundwater surface increases pore-air pressure and hence creates a horizontal pressure gradient which induces air flow as well as groundwater flow in the shoreward direction (Steenhauer et al., 2011a).  The vertical flux into the confined groundwater cell is driven by the difference in hydraulic head at the beach surface, Hih, and at the upper boundary of groundwater flow, Hiη.  If the hydraulic head at the beach surface is greater than the hydraulic head within the confined region of the beach, the surface flow recharges groundwater and q is positive.  The filtration module solves for the corrected value of saturated thickness, hf,n+1 (and thus wetting front and tail level zf,n+1 and zt,n+1), and the vertical volume flux qn+1, with the hydraulic gradient calculated from the updated surface water depth, hn+1, and air pressure within the unsaturated region of the beach, pa,n+1.  Section 3.2 assesses the overall ability of the numerical model to predict swash and subsurface flow within the beach by comparing the measured and model-predicted shoreline trajectory, water profiles, vertical hydraulic gradients and volume time-series.  Position of cell s varies with time, as the confined part of the beach becomes longer when the wetting front reaches the groundwater further in the beach (Fig. 15).  Trial values for the saturated thickness, hf,n*, and for the height of the groundwater level, hη,n*, are predicted based on the updated surface flow depth, hn+1, and the pore-air pressure in the unsaturated region of the beach, pa,n, at the previous time-level, tn.  The swash model of Steenhauer et al. (2011b) simulating the movement of a steep bore over a permeable coarse-grained beach and the movement of the wetting front within the beach has been extended to include the behaviour of air entrapment and groundwater.  The system of equations for the groundwater module is combined into a linear system expressed for one computational cell i as:(23)Ki-1/2wa1Hi-1η,n+1-(Ki-1/2wa1+Ki+1/2wa2+a4)Hiη,n+1+Ki+1/2wa2Hi+1η,n+1=-B1+B2where the individual coefficients of system (23) for the confined and unconfined region of the beach are given as:(24)a1=hiη,n+hi-1η,n2Δxa2=hiη,n+hi+1η,n2Δxa3=Δxzib-zica4={Kiwa3:Iteration1for confined beach(Darcy flux forq)0:Iteration2for confined beach(Forchheimer law forq)θΔxΔt:Unconfined beachB1=Ki-1/2Wa1Hi-1η,n-(Ki-1/2Wa1+Ki+1/2Wa2)Hiη,n+Ki+1/2Wa2Hi+1η,nB2={-Kia3[(WHih,n+wHih,n+1)-WHiη,n]:Iteration1forconfinedbeach-Δxqi:Iteration2forconfinedbeacha4(-pia,n+1ρg-Hiη,n+pia,nρg):Unconfinedbeachwhere 0≤w≤1 denotes the weighting coefficient, where W=(1-w), Hiη is the hydraulic head within the beach in cell i, for the unconfined region of the beach Hiη=hiη+piaρg, hiη is the height of the groundwater in cell i, pia is the air pressure within the unsaturated cell i, ρ is the density of water, g is the gravitational acceleration, Hih is the hydraulic head at the level of the bed based on the surface flow (Hih=zib+hih+pAρg), pA is the atmospheric pressure and qi is the vertical flux expressed in Eq. (20).  The pore-air pressure in the unsaturated region of the beach, pa,n+1, is determined by taking into account the updated surface depth, hn+1 and the wetting front and groundwater predictions, hf,n* and hηn*, respectively.  After the arrival of the wetting front, the region of the beach is considered confined and from this moment the boundary, initially coinciding with the groundwater level, moves towards the bed surface.  They are mainly generated by the increased surface water levels at the lower end of the beach directly recharging groundwater flow.\n",
      "The paper presents a numerical model for bore-driven swash on permeable coarse-grained beaches.  The surface flow module is modelled using the non-linear shallow water equations (NLSWEs), solved using the Godunov-based finite volume ADER scheme, which is suitable for handling steep bores as well as large source terms in the NLSWEs.  The subsurface flow comprises: (i) infiltration and exfiltration modelled as vertical piston-like flow, (ii) horizontal pore-air movement within the unsaturated region of the beach, (iii) the horizontal groundwater flow.  Model predictions of the surface and subsurface flow are in good agreement with measurements from large-scale laboratory experiments for swash on permeable, immobile beaches.  In these simulations air velocity was sufficiently small to justify using Darcy's resistance law for the air flow, whereas the quadratic Forchheimer law had to be used for the infiltration and groundwater flow.  The validated numerical model provides insight into the surface-subsurface water exchange for bore-driven swash on coarse-grained beaches.  The impact of air entrapped between the wetting front and the groundwater level on the water exchange is examined in particular.  ► We model key mechanisms of the water exchange between swash and subsurface.  ► Focus is on filtration and pore-air pressure build-up within the unsaturated beach.  ► Validation is carried out with measurements from large-scale laboratory experiments.  ► Swash model is consistent with experimental results on two coarse-grained beaches.  ► The insights contribute to better understanding and modelling of key swash processes.\n",

      "Summary for An integral contravariant formulation of the fully non-linear Boussinesq equations: In order to verify the need to retain terms up to O(μ2) and O(εμ2) in variable depth power expansion and the term related to the approximation to the second order of the vertical vorticity in the Boussinesq equations, the numerical results obtained with the FNBE scheme are compared with the results obtained with the NBE scheme.  Figs. 2 and 3 show the comparison between computed and measured time-averaged wave heights as the waves propagate up the slope respectively for test cases 1 and 2: the computed values are obtained by using Madsen's equations, Nwogu's equations and the proposed fully non-linear Boussinesq model.  As the weak solutions of the integral form of the motion equations (numerically solved by a shock-capturing scheme) are able to directly simulate wave breaking, the explicit introduction in the equations of terms representing the breaking wave dissipation is not necessary.  The fully non-linear Boussinesq equations expressed in a conservative form in a two-dimensional Cartesian system as a function of the dependent variables H and r→ are:(2)∂H∂t+∇⋅r→=-∇⋅s→(3)∂r→∂t+∇⋅r→⊗r→H+GH∇η=-r→H∇⋅s→-HV→+T→+W→-R→where ⊗ is the tensor product between vectors, G is the constant of gravity, V→ and T→ are the dispersive terms obtained by retaining terms up to O(μ2) and O(εμ2) in depth power expansions of the horizontal velocity according to Wei et al. (1995a), W→ is the term related to the approximation to the second order of the vertical component of the vorticity according to Chen(2006) and R→ is the bottom resistance term.  The comparison between the computed wave heights obtained using the Nwogu's equations and those obtained using the proposed fully non linear Boussinesq model shows the importance of retaining terms up to O(εμ2) in variable depth power expansion.  Figs. 4 and 5 show the comparison between measured and computed values of the mean water level respectively for test cases 1 and 2: the computed values are obtained by using Madsen's equations, Nwogu's equations and the proposed fully non-linear Boussinesq model.  In this paper an integral form of the fully non-linear Boussinesq equations in contravariant formulation has been proposed in which Christoffel symbols are avoided in order to simulate wave transformation phenomena, wave breaking and nearshore currents in computational domains representing the complex morphology of real coastal regions.  In this paper a new integral form of the fully non-linear Boussinesq equations in contravariant formulation is proposed in order to simulate wave evolution, wave breaking and breaking-induced nearshore currents in computational domains representing the complex morphology of real coastal regions.  Velocity and free surface elevation fields obtained by numerical integration of the above-mentioned Boussinesq equations were averaged in time and gave the possibility to predict longshore and rip currents and to simulate the coupled interaction of surface waves and currents.  For this reason the Boussinesq equations are not able to automatically and intrinsecally represent shallow water wave breaking.  Let us indicate with NBE the scheme obtained by applying the same numerical integration procedure to the contravariant motion equations obtained by neglecting in Eqs.  In Fig. 10 is shown the comparison between the spatial evolution of the spectra obtained from the numerical simulations and those presented by Beji and Battjes (1993) for a breaking wave (test D of Table 2).  Their application to the Boussinesq equations is not straightforward because of the presence of high order derivatives in dispersive terms on the right-hand side of Eq.\n",
      "In this paper we propose an integral form of the fully non-linear Boussinesq equations in contravariant formulation, in which Christoffel symbols are avoided, in order to simulate wave transformation phenomena, wave breaking and nearshore currents in computational domains representing the complex morphology of real coastal regions.  Following the approach proposed by Chen (2006), the motion equations retain the term related to the approximation to the second order of the vertical vorticity.  A new Upwind Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory scheme for the solution of the fully non-linear Boussinesq equations on generalised curvilinear coordinate systems is proposed.  The equations are rearranged in order to solve them by a high resolution hybrid finite volume-finite difference scheme.  The conservative part of the above-mentioned equations, consisting of the convective terms and the terms related to the free surface elevation, is discretised by a high-order shock-capturing finite volume scheme in which an exact Riemann solver is involved; dispersive terms and the term related to the approximation to the second order of the vertical vorticity are discretised by a cell-centred finite difference scheme.  The shock-capturing method makes it possible to intrinsically model the wave breaking, therefore no additional terms are needed to take into account the breaking related energy dissipation in the surf zone.  The model is verified against several benchmark tests, and the results are compared with experimental, theoretical and alternative numerical solutions.  We propose a contravariant formulation of the fully non-linear Boussinesq equations.  The presented contravariant formulation is free of Christoffel symbols.  The equations retain the approximation to the second order of the vertical vorticity.  We present a new Upwind Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory scheme.  The shock-capturing scheme allows an explicit simulation of the wave breaking.\n",

      "Summary for Development of a pearl millet Striga-resistant genepool: Response to five cycles of recurrent selection under Striga-infested field conditions in West Africa: Five cycles of phenotypic recurrent selection in a diversified pearl millet genepool resulted in significant improvement for Striga and downy mildew resistance, and increased panicle yield.  Since 2006, the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) in Niger, in partnership with the national agricultural research program in Mali (Institut d'Economie Rurale, IER), has conducted recurrent selection in a diversified pearl millet genepool to increase frequencies of desirable alleles for Striga and downy mildew resistance and panicle yield using two test sites in West Africa (Sadoré in Niger and Cinzana in Mali).  Under Sadoré conditions, most experimental varieties (EVs) derived from the genepool in 2008 (3rd selection cycle) or 2009 (4th selection cycle) present better resistance to Striga and downy mildew than the genepool parental population, except EV09-Cin (for ASNPC), EV08-Sad-SP and EV09-Comb (for DM) (Table 3).  Whether the observed gains in Striga resistance with selection in the pearl millet Striga-resistant genepool are due to these or other mechanisms is yet to be determined.  The genepool was kept open, so that potentially interesting landraces (reported by farmers to be Striga resistant) were included as test entries during the evaluation cycles (all four-replicate field trials), and if above-average Striga resistance and acceptable yield performance was proven, the landrace was included in the FS and S1 creation for the next selection cycle.  Under Sadoré conditions, the mean of the full-sib families (FS) created from the C5 selection cycle was significantly lower (P<0.01) than the mean of the genepool parents (Parent) for both Striga resistance (ASNPC: -51%) and downy mildew incidence (DM: -46%) (Table 3).  The lower measured response from selection for Striga resistance at Cinzana may be attributed to the following factors:-  To date, increased resistance to Striga through recurrent selection has not been reported for pearl millet.  In total, this genepool was subjected to five cycles of recurrent selection, and provides a unique opportunity to examine the effectiveness of recurrent selection for improving Striga and downy mildew resistance, and yield performance in cultivated pearl millet.  Similarly, significant selection gains were observed at Cinzana for panicle yield (+31%) and downy mildew incidence (-62%), but not for Striga resistance, where the C5-FS mean for area under Striga number progress curve was only 1% lower than the Parent group, and the observed difference was statistically non-significant.  Under both sites, the Control group supported the highest Striga damage and lowest panicle yield, while its performance was better at Sadoré for downy mildew resistance compared to the genepool parental means (Table 3).  In Nigeria, recurrent selection of maize for grain yield and Striga resistance had been reported to be successful (Badu-Apraku, 2010; Menkir and Kling, 2007).  According to our knowledge, this is the first report describing significant progress from recurrent selection for quantitative Striga resistance in pearl millet.  In the first and subsequent cycles, selection was based on the following criteria: above-average Striga resistance [i.e.  The development of a marker-assisted population improvement scheme for enhancing quantitative Striga resistance in pearl millet could help render selection even more effective.  In the present study, marked predicted responses were estimated for all target traits, suggesting that enhanced Striga and downy mildew resistance, as well as increased panicle yield are expected also in the next cycle of selection.  The average realized percentage gain from selection for Striga resistance (ASNPC) was -10%cycle-1 at Sadoré and -0.3%cycle-1 at Cinzana, downy mildew susceptibility decreased by 9%cycle-1 at Sadoré and 21%cycle-1 at Cinzana.\n",
      "A Striga-resistant genepool was developed in West African cultivated pearl millet.  We examine the response of the diversified genepool to five cycles of selection.  Selection significantly increased panicle yield, Striga and downy mildew resistance.  The observed genetic variation and heritabilities enable further selection gains.  The derived varieties will contribute to integrated Striga control in West Africa.  Striga hermonthica (Del.) Benth. is a persistent threat to pearl millet [Cenchrus americanus (L.) Morrone, comb.  nov.] production, especially in West Africa.  This study aimed at evaluating the response of a diversified pearl millet genepool to five cycles of recurrent selection targeting Striga resistance and panicle yield, and to a lesser extent downy mildew [Sclerospora graminicola (Sacc.) J.  Schroet.] resistance.  Two-hundred full-sib families (FS) representing the C5 selection cycle were evaluated together with the genepool parental landraces, experimental varieties derived from previous cycles and local checks in Striga-infested fields at Sadoré (Niger) and Cinzana (Mali).  Substantial and mostly significant selection progress could be documented.  The accumulated percentage gain from selection amounted to 51%/1% lower Striga infestation (measured by area under Striga number progress curve, ASNPC), 46%/62% lower downy mildew incidence, and 49%/31% higher panicle yield of the C5-FS compared to the mean of the genepool parents at Sadoré/Cinzana, respectively.  Experimental varieties selected from previous cycles also revealed lower ASNPC and mostly higher yield compared to genepool parents at their selection sites.  Significant genetic variation among the C5-FS and operative heritabilities of 76% (Cinzana), 84% (Sadoré) and 34% (combined across locations) for ASNPC will enable continued selection gain for Striga resistance.  High genotype×environment interaction variances for all target traits suggest that different experimental varieties need to be extracted from the genepool for different sites.  The genepool-derived varieties will be further validated on-farm and are expected to contribute to integrated Striga control in pearl millet in West Africa.\n",

      "Summary for Correlating Mediterranean shallow water deposits with global Oligocene-Miocene stratigraphy and oceanic events: 4b, 5b) and the Orbulina Limestone (Fig. 4e, f) in the Decontra section (Bernoulli et al., 1992; Mutti et al., 1999; Vecsei and Sanders, 1999) as well as by two intervals of planktonic foraminiferal limestones in the Bryozoan Limestone.  The Decontra carbon isotope record is assumed as a proxy for productivity and the δ13C maximum in the Bryozoan Limestone was correlated with the prominent middle Miocene carbon-isotope excursion (the so-called \"Monterey\" event) between ~17 and 13.5Ma (Mutti et al., 1999, 2006; Holbourn et al., 2007; Fig. 6B).  The second depositional sequence begins with a monotonous succession of cross-bedded grainstones dominated by planktonic foraminifers, bryozoans, and echinoderms (Upper Bryozoan Limestone of Mutti et al., 1997, 1999) and ends with Orbulina-rich marls (Orbulina Marls sensu Mutti et al., 1997, 1999; Orbulina Limestone of Carnevale et al., 2011).  The overlying Orbulina Limestone is constrained by the carbon isotope curve to the highstand of the third-order eustatic cycle that follows on the Ser 3 sequence boundary of Hardenbol et al. (1998; Fig. 7).  According to the new carbon isotope stratigraphy, the transition Lepidocyclina Limestone-Cerratina cherty Limestone coincides with the highstand of the third-order eustatic cycle that follows on the Ch 4/Aq 1 sequence boundary of Hardenbol et al. (1998; Fig. 7).  This positive carbon isotope excursion predates the drowning of the Lepidocyclina Limestone ramp and coincides with the Mi-1 glaciation event in the global isotope record of Zachos et al. (2001) (Fig. 7).  Together with the previously reported late Tortonian age for the Lithothamnium Limestone (Merola, 2007; Carnevale et al., 2011), this age model reveals a strong coincidence of the shallow water carbon isotope record from Decontra with the global deep sea carbon isotope curve of Zachos et al. (2001).  Moreover, the age of the Lithothamnium Limestone is ambiguous (?Serravallian), because strontium isotope ages are inconsistent (Mutti et al., 1999).  The deepening trend in the first depositional cycle of Mutti et al. (1997) (Lepidocyclina Limestone and Cerratina cherty Limestone) corresponds to the sea level rise from the beginning of the Chattian to the end of the Burdigalian.  In the Decontra section, the phosphatic hardground in the lower part of the Bryozoan Limestone corresponds to the main phase of phosphogenesis during deposition of the upper main phosphate bed on the Maltese islands at the early-middle Miocene transition (Föllmi et al., 2008).  The herein presented carbon isotope trends conform to those published by Mutti et al. (1997, 1999) from the Decontra section (Fig. 6), which are considered to reflect a primary marine signature.  Due to the dominance of lepidocyclinids this informal lithostratigraphic unit is also named Lepidocyclina Limestone by several authors (Merola, 2007; Carnevale et al., 2011; Brandano et al., 2012).\n",
      "Shallow-marine sediment records have the strong potential to display sensitive environmental changes in sedimentary geometries and skeletal content.  However, the time resolution of most neritic carbonate records is not high enough to be compared with climatic events as recorded in the deep-sea sediment archives.  In order to resolve the paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic changes during the Oligocene-Miocene transition in the Mediterranean shallow water carbonate systems with the best possible time resolution, we re-evaluated the Decontra section on the Maiella Platform (central Apennines, Italy), which acts as a reference for the correlation of Oligocene-Miocene shallow water deposits in the Mediterranean region.  The 120-m-thick late Oligocene-late Miocene carbonate succession is composed of larger foraminiferal, bryozoan and corallinacean limestones interlayered with distinct planktonic foraminiferal carbonates representing a mostly outer neritic setting.  Integrated multi-proxy and facies analyses indicate that CaCO3 and total organic carbon contents as well as gamma-ray display only local to regional processes on the carbonate platform and are not suited for stratigraphic correlation on a wider scale.  In contrast, new biostratigraphic data correlate the Decontra stable carbon isotope record to the global deep-sea carbon isotope record.  This links relative sea level fluctuations, which are reflected by facies and magnetic susceptibility changes, to third-order eustatic cycles.  The new integrated bio-, chemo-, and sequence stratigraphic framework enables a more precise timing of environmental changes within the studied time interval and identifies Decontra as an important locality for correlating not only shallow and deep water sediments of the Mediterranean region but also on a global scale.  We establish a new age model for the Oligo-Miocene Decontra section.  The local carbon isotope record is correlated with the global δ13C curve.  This correlates Mediterranean shallow water records with oceanic/climatic events.\n",

      "Summary for An estimate of post-depositional remanent magnetization lock-in depth in organic rich varved lake sediments: Despite the lack of a bioturbated, mixed surface sediment layer, we must invoke a paleomagnetic lock-in depth of approximately 21-34cm in Gyltigesjön's sediments to obtain the best fit to FENNOSTACK (Snowball et al., 2007).  We compared our paleomagnetic data from the Gyltigesjön sediment sequence to the Fennoscandian paleomagnetic master curves for direction and intensity produced by Snowball et al. (2007).  This system provided four overlapping cores for paleomagnetic reconstructions to a sediment depth of 8m (GD0a, GP1, GP2 and GP4.  Through modelling of the effect of different lock-in depths, which takes into account changes in sediment accumulation rate, and statistical comparison to the regional PSV reference curves we are able to provide a minimum estimate of the paleomagnetic lock-in depth in Gyltigesjön sediments, which have magnetic properties consistent with an assemblage dominated by non-interacting single-domain magnetite magnetosomal magnetite.  It is acknowledged that stable single-domain magnetite grains, often magnetosomal, contribute to the magnetic properties of lacustrine and marine sediments (e.g. Snowball, 1994; Roberts et al., 2011), but very little is known about the depth at which the NRM is locked in, which leads to uncertainties in the ages of paleomagnetic features, including RPI.  One of the preconditions to the formation of varved sediments is the absence of crawling or burrowing fauna and, therefore, it can be expected that a paleomagnetic lock-in depth, if present, would be determined by sediment consolidation and/or the location where magnetic grains of biogeochemical origin are produced.  Varved sediments that have accumulated in Swedish lakes during the Holocene produce high quality paleomagnetic data (Snowball et al., 2007), which is consistent with the observation that the concentration of magnetite magnetofossils (determined by magnetic properties) is positively correlated to the organic carbon content in this sedimentary environment (Snowball et al., 1999, 2002).  One source of uncertainty is the so-called \"paleomagnetic lock-in depth,'\" which causes a time delay between the deposition of sediment and the acquisition of a natural remanent magnetization (NRM).  Another, related, aspect of marine and lacustrine sediments that affects the paleomagnetic lock-in depth is the influence of burrowing or crawling benthic fauna, which cause the top part of a sediment column to be mixed to the extent that no net magnetic remanence can be acquired by this layer.  The visual matches between the Gyltigesjön paleomagnetic data and the reference curves for zero and 21cm lock-in depths are shown in Fig. 11.  To test the hypothesis that a lock-in delay affects the Gyltigesjön paleomagnetic data, we took into account the changes in sediment accumulation rate predicted by the OxCal age-depth model (Fig. 4a) and calculated alternative ages based on different lock-in depths.  The sediments have not been significantly compacted and there are no indications of inclination shallowing in the paleomagnetic data.\n",
      "We studied the paleomagnetic properties of relatively organic rich, annually laminated (varved) sediments of Holocene age in Gyltigesjön, which is a lake in southern Sweden.  An age-depth model was based on a regional lead pollution isochron and Bayesian modelling of radiocarbon ages of bulk sediments and terrestrial macrofossils, which included a radiocarbon wiggle-matched series of 873 varves that accumulated between 3000 and 2000 Cal a BP (Mellström et al., 2013).  Mineral magnetic data and first order reversal curves suggest that the natural remanent magnetization is carried by stable single-domain grains of magnetite, probably of magnetosomal origin.  Discrete samples taken from overlapping piston cores were used to produce smoothed paleomagnetic secular variation (inclination and declination) and relative paleointensity data sets.  Alternative temporal trends in the paleomagnetic data were obtained by correcting for paleomagnetic lock-in depths between 0 and 70cm and taking into account changes in sediment accumulation rate.  These temporal trends were regressed against reference curves for the same region (FENNOSTACK and FENNORPIS; Snowball et al., 2007).  The best statistical matches to the reference curves are obtained when we apply lock-in depths of 21-34cm to the Gyltigesjön paleomagnetic data, although these are most likely minimum estimates.  Our study suggests that a significant paleomagnetic lock-in depth can affect the acquisition of post-depositional remanent magnetization even where bioturbation is absent and no mixed sediment surface layer exists.  Paleomagnetic data obtained from organic rich varved lake sediments.  Chronology based on 14C wiggle-matching and 14C ages of terrestrial macrofossils.  Paleomagnetic lock-in delay quantified to at least 21cm.\n",

      "Summary for Mutations in mitochondrial ribosomal protein MRPL12 leads to growth retardation, neurological deterioration and mitochondrial translation deficiency: We have identified the causative mutation to be in MRPL12, encoding a protein of the large subunit of mitochondrial ribosome.  Although there was an overall decrease in mitochondrial translation compared to control, densitometric profiles showed that certain polypeptides were more affected than others (Fig. 6).  In order to determine whether the MRPL12 mutation also induced changes in composition and assembly of the mitochondrial ribosomal large and small subunits, mitochondrial lysates from cultured fibroblasts (subject and control) were fractionated on isokinetic sucrose gradients (10-30%, as in Ref.  To identify any effect on global mitochondrial protein synthesis, we studied de novo mitochondrial translation in cultured skin fibroblasts, as described in Ref.  Relatively few cases of OXPHOS deficiencies associated with mutations in mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs) have been described so far.  Thus the reduced levels of mutant MRPL12 in this subject correspond to i) loss of stability, ii) a decrease in the free pool that is believed to interact with the mitochondrial RNA polymerase and iii) reduced translation potentially resulting from decreased interactions with translation factors, but with no detectable increase in aberrant translation products.  Since the levels of small and large subunit proteins appeared to be similar in subject and control, these data suggest that the mt-LSU and 55S assembly are unaffected by the mutation consistent with the gradient data for the protein and RNA components.  The steady state level of MRPL12 in the subject's fibroblasts was reduced to 30% of control value (Fig. 4A and B).  SDS-PAGE analysis was performed on either solubilized mitochondrial proteins (40μg) or cell lysate (50μg) extracted from cultured skin fibroblasts.  The mt-LSU protein ICT1 was also decreased (~30% of control values) as was MRPL3 (by 37%) suggesting that a consequence of the MRPL12 mutation is a global defect in assembly of the large ribosomal subunit (mt-LSU).  We show that proteins involved in mitochondrial translation, even close orthologues as submitted here, can defy predictions.  In order to identify if the stoichiometry of MRPL12 per mt-LSU was altered as a consequence of the mutation, we performed immunoprecipitation (IP) analysis on subject and control fibroblasts using antibodies to MRPL12.  Overall levels in the subject sample were decreased to 63% of control value (Fig. 5B) but distribution in the gradient appeared largely unaffected with the exception of fraction 11, where levels were lower than control (Fig. 5A bottom panels).  Since porin indicated that there was no compensatory mitochondrial biogenesis and staining of the mitochondrial network with tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester showed no significant alteration in amount or distribution of mitochondria (AR and ZCL unpublished observation) we conclude that the MRPL12 mutation destabilizes the protein resulting in less mt-LSU and to a lesser extent of the small subunit.\n",
      "Multiple respiratory chain deficiencies represent a common cause of mitochondrial diseases and are associated with a wide range of clinical symptoms.  We report a subject, born to consanguineous parents, with growth retardation and neurological deterioration.  Multiple respiratory chain deficiency was found in muscle and fibroblasts of the subject as well as abnormal assembly of complexes I and IV.  A microsatellite genotyping of the family members detected only one region of homozygosity on chromosome 17q24.2-q25.3 in which we focused our attention to genes involved in mitochondrial translation.  We sequenced MRPL12, encoding the mitochondrial ribosomal protein L12 and identified a c.542C>T transition in exon 5 changing a highly conserved alanine into a valine (p.Ala181Val).  This mutation resulted in a decreased steady-state level of MRPL12 protein, with altered integration into the large ribosomal subunit.  Moreover, an overall mitochondrial translation defect was observed in the subject's fibroblasts with a significant reduction of synthesis of COXI, COXII and COXIII subunits.  Modeling of MRPL12 shows Ala181 positioned in a helix potentially involved in an interface of interaction suggesting that the p.Ala181Val change might be predicted to alter interactions with the elongation factors.  These results contrast with the eubacterial orthologues of human MRPL12, where L7/L12 proteins do not appear to have a selective effect on translation.  Therefore, analysis of the mutated version found in the subject presented here suggests that the mammalian protein does not function in an entirely analogous manner to the eubacterial L7/L12 equivalent.  MRPL12 function is not entirely analogous to the eubacterial L7/L12 equivalent.  Mutations in MRPL12 cause translation defects.  Mutations in apparently universal translation factors can affect different OXPHOS complexes.\n",

      "Summary for Mutation of the human mitochondrial phenylalanine-tRNA synthetase causes infantile-onset epilepsy and cytochrome c oxidase deficiency: Although the FARS2 mutant cells showed a reduction in steady state levels of both complex IV subunits and mt-tRNAPhe, no significant decrease was observed in the de novo synthesis of mitochondrial proteins (Fig. 3E).  To determine whether the FARS2 mutations led to impaired mitochondrial protein synthesis, we next evaluated the incorporation of 35S-methionine/cysteine into de novo synthesised mitochondrial proteins in patient myoblasts, compared to age-matched control cells.  To investigate if the FARS2 mutation in the patient cells was responsible for compromised mt-tRNA aminoacylation efficiency, we assessed in vitro aminoacylation activity of a recombinant FARS2 protein engineered to carry the identical p.Asp325Tyr missense mutation as observed in our patient.  To investigate if the FARS2 mutation in the patient cells was responsible for compromised mt-tRNA aminoacylation efficiency, we assessed in vitro aminoacylation activity of a recombinant FARS2 protein engineered to carry the identical p.Asp325Tyr missense mutation as observed in our patient.  The distribution of the mitochondrial reticulum appeared normal in patient cells compared to controls.  As predicted, wild type FARS2 protein showed high levels of ATP binding in contrast to the mutant p.Asp325Tyr FARS2 protein, which showed no detectable ATP binding (Fig. 5B).  As predicted, wild type FARS2 protein showed high levels of ATP binding in contrast to the mutant p.Asp325Tyr FARS2 protein, which showed no detectable ATP binding (Fig. 5B).  FARS2 mutations affected mt-tRNAPhe steady state levels in myoblasts.  The patient exhibited levels that were approximately 50% of control, consistent with expression from only the maternally inherited allele (Fig. 3C).  In contrast, normal levels of the complex I protein NDUFB8, which is sensitive to CI assembly defects, was observed in both fibroblasts and myoblasts.  The respiratory chain enzyme activities were normal in patient fibroblasts, whilst patient myoblasts demonstrated an isolated complex IV defect, recapitulating the observations in skeletal muscle, albeit with a lesser severity (Fig. 3B, Table 1).  No observable differences were found in either mitochondrial morphology or number (Fig. 4A).\n",
      "Mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) are essential enzymes in protein synthesis since they charge tRNAs with their cognate amino acids.  Mutations in the genes encoding mitochondrial aaRSs have been associated with a wide spectrum of human mitochondrial diseases.  Here we report the identification of pathogenic mutations (a partial genomic deletion and a highly conserved p.  Asp325Tyr missense variant) in FARS2, the gene encoding mitochondrial phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase, in a patient with early-onset epilepsy and isolated complex IV deficiency in muscle.  The biochemical defect was expressed in myoblasts but not in fibroblasts and associated with decreased steady state levels of COXI and COXII protein and reduced steady state levels of the mt-tRNAPhe transcript.  Functional analysis of the recombinant mutant p.  Asp325Tyr FARS2 protein showed an inability to bind ATP and consequently undetectable aminoacylation activity using either bacterial tRNA or human mt-tRNAPhe as substrates.  Lentiviral transduction of cells with wildtype FARS2 restored complex IV protein levels, confirming that the p.Asp325Tyr mutation is pathogenic, causing respiratory chain deficiency and neurological deficits on account of defective aminoacylation of mt-tRNAPhe.  The tissue specific variation in presentation of aaRS mutations is discussed.  A further clinical presentation of a FARS2 defect.  Molecular mechanism of FARS2 defect is characterised in vitro.\n",

      "Summary for High performance inverted bulk heterojunction solar cells by incorporation of dense, thin ZnO layers made using atmospheric atomic layer deposition: Transmittance measurements of annealed 15nm and 125nm thick AALD ZnO films on glass are shown in Fig. 6.  The AALD ZnO coated substrates were heated at 120°C for 10min and 150μL of the P3HT:PCBM blend was then spin-coated on the films at 600rpm for 6s, followed by 1000rpm for 60s.  The device parameters (VOC, JSC, PCE and FF) were found to be fairly constant for AALD ZnO films with a thickness of 40nm or more (Fig. 4a-c).  Working devices with good, but lower performance were obtained without any post-annealing of the as-grown AALD ZnO.  The high transmittance of visible light by the AALD ZnO films is also consistent with the JSC of the best device being comparable with the highest values from literature.  From Fig. 3a, it can be seen that the blend has very good contact with the AALD ZnO layer to the extent that there was no delamination even after fracturing for cross-sectional SEM.  This device was obtained using 125nm thick AALD ZnO (deposited in only 4.5 min) and tested one week after manufacture.  AALD ZnO films are therefore highly suited as multifunctional components for inverted BHJ devices.  Also, since the AALD ZnO films were deposited at 150°C, it is not expected that post-annealing at temperatures lower than 150°C would significantly improve the device performance, especially considering the cost of the increased processing time and increased energy requirement.  By comparing Fig. 3c with 3d (bare ITO), it can be seen that the AALD ZnO film was also conformal to the ITO substrate, since the topography of the ITO can still be seen in the 80nm thick AALD ZnO film.\n",
      "A thin ZnO (<200nm) film grown by Atmospheric Atomic Layer Deposition (AALD) in a matter of minutes was studied as a hole-blocking layer in poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-buyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) based inverted solar cells.  These AALD ZnO layers were compact, had a high electron mobility of 3.4+0.1cm2/Vs, had up to 100% transmittance to visible light, and a good wettability for the blend.  Despite the very rapid, open atmosphere growth method, the cell performance was comparable with some of the best inverted bulk heterojunction P3HT:PCBM cells in the literature.  The performance was also maintained after 200 days of storage in air in the dark.  ZnO was deposited in under 5min using Atmospheric Atomic Layer Deposition (AALD).  AALD is a fast, ambient method that is compatible with roll-to-roll processing.  The AALD ZnO was used as the hole blocking layer in organic solar cells.  The devices had performances comparable with the highest reported in literature.  The low-temperature deposited AALD ZnO can be used in plastic substrate solar cells.\n",

      "Summary for Morphology control in co-evaporated bulk heterojunction solar cells: Thermal annealing not only improves the photocurrent, but also increases Rsh of the devices (for 40-60% PTh) and subsequently enhances the values of Voc.  Development of the donor-acceptor network on annealing is driven by crystallization and re-arrangement of C60 on phase separation from the PTh [62-65].  This particular difference can, however, explain the decrease in Rsh of the 80% PTh devices taking place after annealing, as shown in Table 1.  The XRD traces of the blended 1:1 PTh:C60 composition, shown in Fig. 4, confirm that there is no significant increase in PTh crystallinity upon annealing either.  The enhanced charge generation demonstrated in the PTh:C60 devices shows that the BHJ network can be well-optimized for efficient exciton dissociation by annealing.  The best performance was obtained for 30min annealing at 120°C, the temperature previously assigned by Chen et al. to the glass transition of PTh [38].  In general, the best performance of the vacuum-deposited PTh:C60 devices, both before and after annealing, was found to peak between 40% and 60% PTh with devices showing efficiencies around 0.7%.  Vacuum-deposited PTh:C60 bulk heterojunctions with different donor-acceptor compositions were fabricated and the effect of post-production thermal annealing on their photovoltaic performance and morphology studied.  The films with higher PTh content show better overlap with the solar spectrum, as seen in Fig. 3.  The trend of RMS roughness reaches a minimum at the PTh composition between 40% and 60% (see Fig. 6a).  Finally, we have demonstrated that the morphology of vacuum-deposited PTh:C60 bulk heterojunctions can be controlled over a wide range of compositions.  Furthermore, by annealing the devices post-situ we improved their power conversion efficiency by as much as 80%, achieving performance comparable to PTh:PCBM equivalents processed in solution from thermo-cleavable precursors [52].\n",
      "Bulk heterojunction solar cells made by vacuum co-evaporation of polythiophene (PTh) and fullerene (C60) are reported and the blend morphology control through donor-acceptor composition and post-situ annealing demonstrated.  Co-deposited heterojunctions are shown to generate about 60% higher photocurrents than their thickness-optimized PTh/C60 planar heterojunction counterparts.  Furthermore, by annealing the devices post-situ the power conversion efficiency is improved by as much as 80%.  UV-vis, XRD and AFM analysis shows that the enhanced photoresponse is a result of favorable morphological development of PTh upon annealing.  Annealing-induced improvement of the donor-acceptor network is demonstrated across a wide range of compositions (20-80% PTh).  This illustrates that good morphology control is possible in co-evaporated polymer-fullerene blends through multiple parameters and differentiates this donor-acceptor combination from the standard small-molecule systems.  Vacuum deposition of polymer/fullerene bulk heterojunction solar cells is reported.  Their performance is optimized through composition as well as post-situ thermal annealing.  Annealing enhances efficiency over a wide range of D:A blend compositions (1:4-4:1).  Improved blend morphology results from favorable phase separation of the polymer.  Morphology control in the polymer blend is superior to the equivalent oligomer blends.\n",

      "Summary for Influences on the energy delivery of thin film photovoltaic modules: There are a large number of performance studies reported, some with the aim of understanding the behaviour of a single type of device and some to compare the energy yields of different devices.  In the case of amorphous silicon devices, the device structure, number of junctions, material of the junctions as well as manufacturing can impact on the energy yield significantly [12,13].  It is demonstrated that when the energy yield of a module should be investigated either through modelling or through measurements, the long term behaviour can have a much more significant influence on the device productivity than the effect of the environment.  The overall impact on annual energy yield is slightly positive for a-Si devices and virtually zero for the other technologies.  The other devices have a much more balanced behaviour in the course of the year, where different performance effects appear to balance.  The losses in annual energy generation are even higher for the majority of devices, leading to difference between the lifetime specific energy yield of different devices as much as 25%, assuming 25 year warranties, the current standard.  The ageing of devices affects the energy yield significantly.  To demonstrate the effects in device behaviour the outdoor data for 2009 was binned according to irradiance and temperature, as shown in Fig. 5 for two contrasting examples.  It is shown that the effect of irradiance on device performance is largely due to device design, while the temperature and spectral response are dominated by the band gap and material quality of the absorber layer.  Thus, the relatively high temperature coefficient of c-Si does not affect the device performance as much as it would in other locations.  It was already pointed out that many studies are carried out to quantify environmental effects for specific devices.  The analysis is of the key influences on energy delivery of these specific devices and is not meant as a generalisation for any of the technologies in the test.  The number of design parameters of thin film devices is larger and the production processes are less standardised than for c-Si, resulting in wide variation in the specific energy yield of modules of the same material technology.  The device has seen several years of outdoor performance beforehand, and newer devices may have better low light behaviour, but samples with similar behaviour are still in the marketplace.  The effects of the modifications in series resistance and temperature coefficients on the specific energy yield depend on the particular location environments and the device responses relative to STC.  The distribution obtained for the crystalline device is much narrower than those of the thin film devices.  A widening of the PDF indicates that devices become more susceptible to changes in the environmental conditions and measurement uncertainties or changes between detector-response and that of the device become increasingly significant.  It is apparent from Fig. 7 that there is only a small spectral dependence for c-Si and CIGS devices.\n",
      "The energy yield delivered by different types of photovoltaic device is a key consideration in the selection of appropriate technologies for cheap photovoltaic electricity.  The different technologies currently on the market, each have certain strengths and weaknesses when it comes to operating in different environments.  There is a plethora of comparative tests on-going with sometimes contradictory results.  This paper investigates device behaviour of contrasting thin film technologies, specifically a-Si and CIGS derivatives, and places this analysis into context with results reported by others.  Specific consideration is given to the accuracy of module inter-comparisons, as most outdoor monitoring at this scale is conducted to compare devices against one another.  It is shown that there are five main contributors to differences in energy delivery and the magnitude of these depends on the environments in which the devices are operated.  The paper shows that two effects, typically not considered in inter-comparisons, dominate the reported energy delivery.  Environmental influences such as light intensity, spectrum and operating temperature introduce performance variations typically in the range of 2-7% in the course of a year.  However, most comparative tests are carried out only for short periods of time, in the order of months.  Here, the power rating is a key factor and adds uncertainty for new technologies such as thin films often in the range of 10-15%.  This dominates inter-comparisons looking at as-new, first-year energy yields, yet considering the life-time energy yield it is found that ageing causes up to 25% variation between different devices.  The durability of devices and performance-maintenance is thus the most significant factor affecting energy delivery, a major determinant of electricity cost.  The discussion is based on long-term measurements carried out in Loughborough, UK by the Centre for Renewable Energy Systems Technology (CREST) at Loughborough University.  The paper investigates the energy delivery of thin film photovoltaic devices in a maritime climate for amorphous silicon based modules and Copper -Indium, Gallium -DiSelenide based devices Effects on the energy delivery of thin film photovoltaics are separated and quantified.  Key contributors are measurement accuracy and changes in device behaviour with time rather than environment.  Effects of temperature, irradiance and spectrum are investigated and quantified.  The differences in long term ageing of different devices is quantified.\n",

      "Summary for Minority carrier lifetime in silicon photovoltaics: The effect of oxygen precipitation: It is noted that the same fit parameters can be used to fit lifetime data from samples with a high bulk lifetime (low precipitate density) and low bulk lifetime (iron contaminated precipitates with a high density), which suggests that differences between surface recombination rates between samples are not substantial.  By studying the injection-dependence of minority carrier lifetime as a function of doping level in both p-type and n-type silicon it has been possible to quantify recombination at oxide precipitates in terms of SRH statistics.  Injection-dependent lifetime measurements on a set of p-type iron contaminated samples are plotted in Fig. 6.  (7)), so reductions in lifetime are assumed to be due to recombination associated with iron segregated to oxide precipitates and any surrounding defects (dislocations and stacking faults).  It is not possible to measure the interstitial iron concentration in n-type samples, so no correction is made for bulk iron-related recombination in such samples, and, besides which, the recombination activity of iron in n-type silicon is generally much less significant than in p-type silicon [45].  The lifetime data for such samples could be fitted with the same recombination parameters extracted from the samples for which the better surface passivation scheme was used.  We have used injection-dependent minority carrier lifetime measurements to study this recombination activity in ∼100 samples with different types, doping levels, precipitate morphologies and sizes.  We therefore conclude that at least some of the recombination activity of oxide precipitates in \"uncontaminated\" samples is due to the segregation of iron to the precipitates and surrounding defects.  In Fig. 3, the residual minority carrier lifetime measured in uncontaminated samples containing oxide precipitates is plotted against X=n/p for two p-type specimens and Y=p/n for two n-type specimens.  Under the stated assumptions, this gives us the full parameterisation necessary to estimate carrier lifetime due to iron-decorated oxide precipitates in p-type and n-type silicon.  This, combined with previously published data on samples with a wider variety of precipitate concentrations [23], suggests that segregated iron determines the recombination activity of the strained oxide precipitates and surrounding defects.  (1)) are used with the recombination parameters of Rein and Glunz [30] to determine the bulk iron concentration required to account for a lifetime change at a given injection level.  Remarkably, we find the same defect states in oxide precipitate-containing samples which have been intentionally contaminated with iron.  It is interesting to note that the recombination activity of oxide precipitates in both \"uncontaminated\" and contaminated samples appears to be approximately dependent upon precipitate density and not size.\n",
      "Single-crystal Czochralski silicon used for photovoltaics is typically supersaturated with interstitial oxygen at temperatures just below the melting point.  Oxide precipitates therefore can form during ingot cooling and cell processing, and nucleation sites are typically vacancy-rich regions.  Oxygen precipitation gives rise to recombination centres, which can reduce cell efficiencies by as much as 4% (absolute).  We have studied the recombination behaviour in p-type and n-type monocrystalline silicon with a range of doping levels intentionally processed to contain oxide precipitates with a range of densities, sizes and morphologies.  We analyse injection-dependent minority carrier lifetime measurements to give a full parameterisation of the recombination activity in terms of Shockley-Read-Hall statistics.  We intentionally contaminate specimens with iron, and show recombination activity arises from iron segregated to oxide precipitates and surrounding defects.  We find that phosphorus diffusion gettering reduces the recombination activity of the precipitates to some extent.  We also find that bulk iron is preferentially gettered to the phosphorus diffused layer rather than to oxide precipitates.  Oxygen precipitation reduces absolute efficiency of silicon solar cells by up to 4%.  Full parameterisation of minority carrier lifetime due to oxide precipitates.  Iron contamination of oxide precipitates increases recombination activity.  Recombination activity reduced by phosphorus diffusion gettering.  Bulk iron gettered to phosphorus diffused layer, not oxide precipitates.\n",

      "Summary for Colloidal construction of porous polysaccharide-supported cadmium sulphide: Here, the synthesis of high surface area, CdS/mesoporous starch (MS) hybrids are presented, where the unique environment of a starch gel is utilised to confine the growth of the CdS phase.  The complimentary interaction of the porous polysaccharide (starch) gel and the growing CdS inorganic phase and the resulting electrostatic repulsive forces generated materials with very high nanoparticle loadings, surprisingly high surface area, volumes and small CdS species.  Images of the presented CdS/MS materials acquired by TEM indicate that at low CdS loadings, the CdS phase is well distributed and dispersed within the porous structure, with individual CdS nanoparticle having ∼4-6nm diameters (Fig. 6(A)).  The CdS/MS materials, prepared at increasing CdS/starch (w/w) ratios, are synthesised in a straightforward manner based on green chemistry principles [13], demonstrating the straightforward, utile and transferable nature of the presented approach.  Preparation of mesoporous starch (MS)-supported CdS materials (CdS/MS) was conducted adapting a method developed by Hullavarad et al. [14] which conveniently allowed the introduction of the cadmium acetate and sodium sulfide precursors during solvent exchange in the preparation of MS.  CdS/MS materials were prepared at increasing cadmium to starch ratios (w/w) and the bright yellow colouration observed during the addition of the reagents to the starch gel was maintained in the recovered solid with (as expected) a higher loading of CdS indicated by an increasingly stronger yellow appearance (Fig. 1).  By comparison with previous reports and associated diffraction peaks for bulk CdS, and the diffraction patterns of CdS/MS materials presented here (i.e. CdS1 and CdS2), all the characteristic peaks are broadened, in agreement with the nature of the nanocrystalline (i.e. cubic phase) CdS [16].  To characterise the optical absorption properties of the prepared CdS/MS materials, DRUVs spectroscopy was employed (Fig. 5).  Such a reorganisation and restructuring of the polysaccharide phase with increasing CdS loading can potentially be explained by repulsive forces and changes in surface charge as the porous hybrid structure is formed, generating the observed higher total pore volumes and expansion of the corresponding pore size distributions (Fig. 4).  It is important to note that the presented results are somewhat unexpected given previous work (e.g. a pore filling model with PdNPs) [11(b)], and highlights the unusual nature of these porous polysaccharide networks - via the introduction of charged species and growth of CdS nanoparticles within the porous structure, the material porosity adapts, presumably as the flexible soft, biopolymer network adapts its porosity to accommodate the growing CdS phase.  Pure control samples of MS and CdS were also prepared to provide comparison.  With increasing CdS loading, the diffraction patterns become better resolved from the amorphous MS support pattern.  The CdS control sample prepared in the absence of starch (CdS4), presented a low surface area (<5m2g-1; Table 1).  Bulk CdS prepared in the absence of starch gel in an identical manner.  Polysaccharides (and saccharides) have previously been employed to stabilise QDs (including CdS) [12], but significantly there have thus far been no reports that describe the use of porous polysaccharides (e.g. mesoporous starch) in the preparation of high surface area, (meso)porous QDs/polysaccharide hybrids.\n",
      "The preparation of high surface area, mesoporous cubic CdS/starch hybrids is presented.  A colloidal starch gel confines CdS growth to small, cubic nanoparticles (<40nm).  The method allows very high CdS loadings (i.e. 1:1wt/wt).  The gel and CdS phase interact to maintain surface and porosity of original gel.  The green route is applicable to a range of quantum dots and polysaccharide gels.  A method for preparing CdS nanoparticles within the porous confines of a mesoporous starch gel is described.  This method utilises the combined colloidal and flexible chemical nature of a porous polysaccharide (i.e. starch) gel to limit CdS growth.  The resulting hybrid gels can be dried to produce CdS/starch materials with high surface areas, predominantly mesoporous characteristics and scope for high CdS loading.  The synthesis is conducted in aqueous alcoholic solutions without the need for expensive preparation techniques or additional protection/templating strategies.  Materials were prepared at increasing CdS loadings on the starch gel, which confined nanoparticle growth and directed size/surface coverage, dispersion and UV-vis absorption profile.  The resulting powders presented large mesopore domains with high volumes (pore diameters>10nm; Vmeso>0.5cm3g-1) and surface areas (SBET>170m2g-1), interestingly effectively increasing with CdS loading.  The synthesised CdS nanoparticles were characterised in the 5-40nm range of a cubic crystalline structure, increasing in size with loading.  A complete surface coverage of the starch gel structure occurs at a CdS/starch ratio=1 (w/w), allowing the synthesis of a unique mesoporous CdS/polysaccharide hybrid.  The presented route is simple, green and in principle extendable to a wide range of QDs and polysaccharide gels, whereby the porous polysaccharide gel acts as the deposition point of Cd2+, directing and stabilising both the growth of the inorganic CdS phase and the expanded high surface area polysaccharide form.\n",

      "Summary for Incremental approaches for updating approximations in set-valued ordered information systems: Given a SOIS S=(U,C∪{d},V,f) at time t, the deletion of object x¯∈U (x¯ denotes the deleted object) will change the original information granules [x]AΔ⩾ (x∈U,A⊆C) and the union of decision classes Di⩾ (1⩽i⩽r).  Algorithm 1 is a static (non-incremental) algorithm for computing the lower and upper approximations in SOIS while the object set in the information system is changed.  Zhang et al. discussed the change of approximations in neighborhood decision systems when the object set evolves over time, and proposed two fast incremental algorithms for updating approximations when multiple objects enter into or get out of the neighborhood decision table [33].  Algorithm 2 is an incremental algorithm for updating approximations in SOIS while deleting an object from the universe.  Algorithm 3 is an incremental algorithm for updating approximations in SOIS while inserting an object into the universe.  Based on the above analysis, we can compute the approximations of the union of existing decision classes Di⩾ (1⩽i⩽r) when inserting a new object into SOIS.  In this section, we design static and incremental algorithms on the variation of the object set in SOIS corresponding to Sections 2 and 3, respectively.  Experimental studies pertaining to four UCI data sets and two artificial data sets showed that the incremental algorithms can improve the computational efficiency for updating approximations when the object set in the information system varies over time.  In this section, we discuss the variation of approximations in the dynamic SOIS when the object set evolves over time while the attribute set remains constant.\n",
      "Incremental learning is an efficient technique for knowledge discovery in a dynamic database, which enables acquiring additional knowledge from new data without forgetting prior knowledge.  Rough set theory has been successfully used in information systems for classification analysis.  Set-valued information systems are generalized models of single-valued information systems, which can be classified into two categories: disjunctive and conjunctive.  Approximations are fundamental concepts of rough set theory, which need to be updated incrementally while the object set varies over time in the set-valued information systems.  In this paper, we analyze the updating mechanisms for computing approximations with the variation of the object set.  Two incremental algorithms for updating the approximations in disjunctive/conjunctive set-valued information systems are proposed, respectively.  Furthermore, extensive experiments are carried out on several data sets to verify the performance of the proposed algorithms.  The results indicate the incremental approaches significantly outperform non-incremental approaches with a dramatic reduction in the computational speed.\n",

      "Summary for An experimental comparison of classification algorithms for imbalanced credit scoring data sets: For this empirical study our focus is on the performance of classification techniques on data sets with a large class imbalance.  These data sets will then have the size of their minority class of defaulters further reduced by decrements of 5% (from an original 70/30 good/bad split) to see how the performance of the various classification techniques is affected by increasing class imbalance.  Hence, the aim of this paper is to conduct a study of various classification techniques based on five real-life credit scoring data sets.  In this comparative study we have looked at a number of credit scoring techniques, and studied their performance over various class distributions in five real-life credit data sets.  Secondly, another interesting extension to the research would be to apply these techniques on much larger data sets which display a wider variety of class distributions.  Furthermore, many empirical studies only evaluate a small number of classification techniques on a single credit scoring data set.  For the purpose of this study, ten classifiers have been selected which provide a balance between well-established credit scoring techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees and neural networks, and newly developed machine learning techniques such as least square support vector machines, gradient boosting and random forests.  The Friedman test statistic is based on the average ranked (AR) performances of the classification techniques on each data set, and is calculated as follows:(11)χF2=12DK(K+1)∑j=1KARj2-K(K+1)24,whereARj=1D∑i=1Drij.In (13), D denotes the number of data sets used in the study, K is the total number of classifiers and rij is the rank of classifier j on data set i.  At the level where only 15% of the data sets are bad observations, it is shown in the significance diagram that gradient boosting becomes the best performing classifier (see Fig. 3).\n",
      "In this paper, we set out to compare several techniques that can be used in the analysis of imbalanced credit scoring data sets.  In a credit scoring context, imbalanced data sets frequently occur as the number of defaulting loans in a portfolio is usually much lower than the number of observations that do not default.  As well as using traditional classification techniques such as logistic regression, neural networks and decision trees, this paper will also explore the suitability of gradient boosting, least square support vector machines and random forests for loan default prediction.  Five real-world credit scoring data sets are used to build classifiers and test their performance.  In our experiments, we progressively increase class imbalance in each of these data sets by randomly under-sampling the minority class of defaulters, so as to identify to what extent the predictive power of the respective techniques is adversely affected.  The performance criterion chosen to measure this effect is the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC); Friedman's statistic and Nemenyi post hoc tests are used to test for significance of AUC differences between techniques.  The results from this empirical study indicate that the random forest and gradient boosting classifiers perform very well in a credit scoring context and are able to cope comparatively well with pronounced class imbalances in these data sets.  We also found that, when faced with a large class imbalance, the C4.5 decision tree algorithm, quadratic discriminant analysis and k-nearest neighbours perform significantly worse than the best performing classifiers.\n",

      "Summary for Robust VAWT control system evaluation by coupled aerodynamic and electrical simulations: For the control strategy showed in Fig. 3, k1 and ω0 are chosen so that the turbine starts to absorb power at λ=4 for 3 m/s wind speed and maximum CP is still obtained for 6 m/s.  The aim of the control strategy is, for each wind speed, to have a stable equilibrium at a rotational velocity that gives a high power coefficient.  This paper investigates control strategies where the extracted power is determined from the rotor speed alone, i.e.  The investigation here treats control strategies which operate without measurements of the wind speed and where the generator torque is determined from the rotational velocity of the turbine.  The equilibria in the power plot illustrate the steady state performance while the speed of the control strategy is directly proportional to the difference in torque.  As the power is proportional to the cube of the wind speed, keeping the correct tip speed ratio at high wind speeds is more important, which is the reason for the improved performance of strategies A-C, compared to the reference control strategy, during very rapid wind oscillations.  Experiences from the test setup in Marsta [25] indicate that the actual power coefficient at low tip speed ratios is higher than the simulated values, which increases the stability of the control strategy and should therefore not be an issue for the chosen control strategy.  The simulated performance is only slightly lower than for a reference control strategy with known wind speed.  To tune this strategy for the highest power coefficient at a given wind speed, both λmax and CPmax have to be known at this speed.  To further illustrate the control strategies at low rotational velocities, the power and torque are plotted against the rotational velocity in Fig. 5 and are compared to the aerodynamic torque for wind speeds of 4.5 m/s and 6 m/s.  Control strategies A-C are implemented by controlling the load current so that the average of the extracted power Pe from the turbine is as close as possible to the power Pe* prescribed by the applied control strategy.  If this strategy operates at the stable equilibrium and there is an increase in wind speed, the aerodynamic power will increase, hence P>Pe and the turbine will accelerate until a new equilibrium is reached (compare with Fig. 5).  The reference strategy uses both the asymptotic wind speed and the rotational velocity as control signals.\n",
      "A control system for a vertical axis wind turbine is presented.  The electric load is determined solely from the rotational velocity and the characteristics of the turbine, thus measurements of the incoming wind speed are not required.  The control system is evaluated with an aerodynamic vortex model coupled with an electrical model.  Three different sets of control system parameters are tested, representing different tradeoffs between a high power absorption and achieving a fast control strategy with high stability.  The simulations show that the three control strategies provide a similar power absorption as a reference strategy based on known wind speed.  For dynamic simulations with fast changes in wind speed, the fast control strategies are beneficial.  All control strategies are stable throughout the simulations when proper power absorption characteristics of the turbine are used.  It is also shown that if peak power absorption is estimated at a too low tip speed ratio, the control strategies may inadvertently stop the turbine.  A coupled aerodynamic - electric simulation model is presented.  A control strategy for VAWT that does not require wind measurements is evaluated.  Accuracy of control strategy versus convergence speed is analysed.  The sensitivity of the control parameters is investigated.\n",

      "Summary for Aerodynamic and electrical evaluation of a VAWT farm control system with passive rectifiers and mutual DC-bus: At the time when the mutual topology stops extracting power from turbine 4, the rest of the turbines increase their rotational velocities faster, as the increases in delivered power from turbines 1 and 2 no longer are compensated for by a decrease in power from turbine 4, see Eq.  Even though the reduced turbine power absorption for the mutual topology appears significant for both turbines 3 and 4 (see Fig. 6), those two turbines are the ones that deliver the least energy.  Therefore, the topology is not as important if the differences in wind speed are caused by mutual turbine interaction, compared to the independent turbines in Section 6.1.  The control system used with the separate topology works well for independent turbines, but it is not optimised for turbine farms.  For the line configuration, where the turbines are nearly independent, this is disadvantageous as it does not allow each turbine to fully adapt to the changes in wind speed.  [10], a control strategy where the extracted power is proportional to the cube of the wind speed was applied to a horizontal axis turbine.  The aim is instead to show that a simple topology, such as the mutual DC-bus, can be a viable solution for the control of a vertical axis turbine farm as it can obtain relatively good performance without the need for wind speed measurements and additional electrical components.  The method also includes the mutual aerodynamic interaction of the turbines, making it possible to study the control system behaviour when one turbine is in the wake of another.  The significant change in behaviour for the mutual topology at time 1800 s occurs when the turbine that experiences the lowest wind speed (turbine 4) stops delivering power and all turbine power is used to overcome the generator core loss.  It was seen in Section 6.1 that for large variations in wind speed between the turbines, the separate topology should perform better, which is seen here.  In the case with significant differences in wind speed between different turbines, it is investigated if the total power for the mutual topology can be increased through modification of the extracted power according to(14)Pe,k=k∑i=1NPe(ωi).  If the wind speed differences among the turbines are due to the turbines' mutual interaction, the mutual and the separate topologies are almost equal in performance.  The extracted power from a turbine in another turbines wake is therefore not as accurate as a more realistic full three-dimensional model, especially when the distances between the turbines are large.\n",
      "A wind farm with a simple electrical topology based on passive rectifiers and a single inverter (mutual topology) is compared to a more complex topology where each turbine has a separate inverter (separate topology).  In both cases, the turbines are controlled electrically by varying the extracted power with the rotational velocity as control signal.  These two electrical topologies are evaluated with respect to the absorbed power for a farm of four turbines placed either on a line or in a square configuration.  The evaluation is done with a vortex model for the aerodynamics, coupled with a model of the electromechanical system.  Simulations predict that individual control is beneficial for aerodynamically independent turbines if the wind speeds differ significantly between the turbines.  If the differences in wind speed are caused by one turbine operating in the wake of another, the deviations in power output between the topologies are less prominent.  The mutual topology can even deliver more power than the separate topology when one turbine is in the wake of another turbine if the wind speed changes rapidly.  A VAWT farm is simulated with vortex model coupled with electric model.  An electric system with passive rectifiers and a mutual DC-bus has been evaluated.  The proposed electric system is viable for a vertical axis wind turbine farm.  The aerodynamic interactions between the turbines is important for the evaluation.  The inter turbine distance is far more important than the electrical topology.\n",

      "Summary for Tidal turbine array optimisation using the adjoint approach: For the turbine optimisation problem considered here, the design parameter m is a vector containing the positions, and optionally the tuning parameters, of the turbines.  For the turbine optimisation problem, we wish to maximise a single output (the power extracted) with respect to many input parameters (the positions and tuning parameters of the turbines); this means that the adjoint approach is the natural choice, as the required gradient information can be computed in a number of equation solves that is independent of the number of turbines.  In this work, the optimal configuration of tidal turbine farms was formulated as an optimisation problem constrained by partial differential equations describing the flow.  To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first application of the adjoint method to the optimisation of turbine arrays.  In all numerical experiments, the optimisation algorithm was initialised with the 32 turbines deployed in a regular 8 × 4 grid and with box constraints for the turbine positions to ensure that the turbines remain inside the site areas.  In the context of the turbine layout problem, a typical condition is to restrict the area in which the turbines may be placed to the development site.  The use of gradient-based optimisation algorithms combined with the adjoint technique enables the use of physically-realistic flow models, even for a large number of turbines.  This gradient is used by the optimisation algorithm to automatically reposition the turbines and to adjust their tuning parameters.  In Section 2, we formulate the turbine configuration problem as an optimisation problem constrained by the shallow water equations.  Layout optimisation of 256 tidal stream turbines in the Inner Sound of the Pentland Firth, Scotland.  Layout optimisation of 128 tidal stream turbines in the Inner Sound of the Pentland Firth, Scotland.  The functional gradient is the key piece of information that makes the optimisation of large numbers of turbines tractable.  Second, the optimisation parameters were extended to include the friction coefficients K of each turbine in the parameterisation (5).  It fully accounts for the nonlinear interactions between the geometry, the turbines, and the flow throughout the optimisation.  Firstly, it closes the optimisation loop, by accounting for the effects of the turbines on the flow field itself.  The source-code of the turbine farm optimisation software and all examples are open-source and available at http://opentidalfarm.org.  The top part of the video shows the turbine positions at each optimisation iteration zoomed into the site area.\n",
      "Oceanic tides have the potential to yield a vast amount of renewable energy.  Tidal stream generators are one of the key technologies for extracting and harnessing this potential.  In order to extract an economically useful amount of power, hundreds of tidal turbines must typically be deployed in an array.  This naturally leads to the question of how these turbines should be configured to extract the maximum possible power: the positioning and the individual tuning of the turbines could significantly influence the extracted power, and hence is of major economic interest.  However, manual optimisation is difficult due to legal site constraints, nonlinear interactions of the turbine wakes, and the cubic dependence of the power on the flow speed.  The novel contribution of this paper is the formulation of this problem as an optimisation problem constrained by a physical model, which is then solved using an efficient gradient-based optimisation algorithm.  In each optimisation iteration, a two-dimensional finite element shallow water model predicts the flow and the performance of the current array configuration.  The gradient of the power extracted with respect to the turbine positions and their tuning parameters is then computed in a fraction of the time taken for a flow solution by solving the associated adjoint equations.  These equations propagate causality backwards through the computation, from the power extracted back to the turbine positions and the tuning parameters.  This yields the gradient at a cost almost independent of the number of turbines, which is crucial for any practical application.  The utility of the approach is demonstrated by optimising turbine arrays in four idealised scenarios and a more realistic case with up to 256 turbines in the Inner Sound of the Pentland Firth, Scotland.  The layout optimisation of tidal farms was formulated as a PDE-constrained optimisation problem.  Gradient-based optimisation and the adjoint approach allow the optimisation of many turbines with realistic flow models.  A shallow water model predicts the flow and the farm performance in each optimisation iteration.  The capability of this approach is demonstrated by optimising 256 turbines in a farm in the Inner Sound of the Pentland Firth, Scotland.  The software framework is open-source and available at http://opentidalfarm.org.\n",

      "Summary for Simulations of a vertical axis turbine in a channel: 6 and 9, equation (9) can theoretically be used to estimate the power coefficient for the turbine in free flow if a simulation is performed with channel walls.  The study has later been extended by Vennell [32,33], who combined the reduction in flow velocity with a model of how the turbine's efficiency depends on blockage and demonstrated that the maximum power coefficient of the turbine becomes limited due to the reduction of the flow in the channel.  The simulations show that a turbine in a channel experiences an increase in power coefficient compared to a turbine in a free flow and that the peak for the power coefficient occurs at a higher tip speed ratio.  In this case, the turbine peaks for a power coefficient of 53.3% for free flow.  The more general case with a channel of arbitrary width has been studied by Garrett and Cummings [1], and according to their estimates, the maximum power that can be extracted in a channel is(9)Pmax=CP,max12Aρu03(1-ε)2,where A is the turbine cross-sectional area, u0 is the asymptotic flow velocity, ρ is the density and CP,max is the maximum power coefficient for free flow, i.e.  The power coefficient of the single turbine reference case in free flow can be found in Fig. 1 for four different turbine solidities(12)σ=NbcR.Here, Nb is the number of blades, c is the chord and R is the radius.  With the same convergence criterion as for the free flow and all turbines simulated at optimal tip speed ratio, the convergence for a turbine with σ = 0.12 is given in Fig. 4.  Compared to the idealized theoretical maximum for channels, the simulations show that the increase in performance due to the channel for a turbine optimized for free flow is smaller than the simple analytical expectation, and this difference increases with increased blockage ratio.  This also work the other way around: If a turbine is optimized while in a channel, it will probably not be optimal for the free flow case, which should be taken into account for all volume discretization methods.  Note that the required number of revolutions for convergence varies substantially, depending on many parameters, such as the channel length, how much the turbine decreases the flow velocity etc.  For the design of the turbine, the simulations with higher solidities show that when designing a turbine for a channel, the optimal design will be different compared to the free flow case.  The simulations also indicate that the turbine should be designed differently for the channel case.  In reality, the flow can pass above and beneath the turbine as well as on the sides, which gives a lower blockage ratio than the two-dimensional case.  In this case, the flow boundaries increase turbine performance [1,2].\n",
      "The power coefficient of a turbine increases according to the predictions from streamtube theory for sites with a confined fluid flow.  Here, a vertical axis turbine (optimized for free flow) has been simulated by a two-dimensional vortex method, both in a channel and in free flow.  The first part of the study concerns the numerical parameters of channel simulations.  It is found that for free flow and wide channels, a large number of revolutions is required for convergence (around 100 at the optimal tip speed ratio and increasing with higher tip speed ratio), while for smaller channels, the required number of revolutions decreases.  The second part analyses changes in turbine performance by the channel boundaries.  The turbine performance increases when the channel width is decreased, although the results are below the predictions from streamtube theory, and this difference increases with decreasing channel width.  It is also observed that the optimal tip speed ratio increases with decreasing channel width.  By increasing the chord, which decreases the optimal tip speed ratio, the power coefficient can be increased somewhat.  Theory for extending a vortex model to a channel included.  The extracted power for a turbine increases with decreasing channel width.  The optimal tip speed ratio for a turbine increases with decreasing channel width.  Turbines in a channel should have larger blades than in free flow.  Wide channels require many simulated revolution for convergence.\n",

Based on the simulated wind speeds and the model of turbine installed at each farm, the ideal load factor of UK onshore wind farms should average 38.4%, whereas the mean observed load factor for these farms from 2002 to 12 has been 26.3%.  We therefore use wind speed data with high temporal and spatial resolution, and measure the performance of wind farms by estimating their theoretical potential output over the course of a month and comparing this with the actual reported load factors.  Figs. 2 and 3 show what has happened to the load factor of these wind farms as they get older.  Simulated ideal outputs are compared with actual monthly load factors from a large portion of the UK's fleet over the last decade (282 wind farms, 4.5 GW, 53 TWh), yielding the normalised performance of each wind farm accounting for its wind resource availability, and a set of weather-corrected load factors which reveal the effects of ageing.  The cumulative lifetime output of a 100 MW wind farm with a 28.5% load factor would be 4.99 TWh over 20 years.  Wake effects: wind farms suffer from power loss as interactions between neighbouring turbines increase turbulence and reduce wind speeds; for relatively small (up to 20 turbine) onshore farms estimates are in the region of 5-15% [25,32-35];  When variations in the weather and improvement in turbine design are accounted for, we find that the load factors of UK wind farms fall by 1.57% (0.41 percentage points) per year.  That report suggested that the load factors of wind farms in the UK have declined by 5-13% per year, normalising for month-by-month variations in wind speeds.  This paper uses public domain data to infer the hour-by-hour wind speeds at the site of every wind farm in the UK, and the power curve for each farm's model of turbine to estimate the output that they would ideally produce.  We compiled the power curves for 50 of these turbine models, accounting for 92% of the wind farms in the UK.  On the other hand, national average data cannot reveal what is happening at individual wind farms.  In our model, the systematic effect of location-specific wind speeds and turbine model are both incorporated in the ideal load factor data, while the site dummy variables measure the extent to which each farm's surroundings and layout systematically give it more or less wind than the simulation predicts.  Several factors can confound the relationship between age and observed output in a fleet of wind farms, given that a turbine's output is dependent on wind speeds at its site and the efficiency with which it captures the energy in that wind.  The finding that wind turbines lose around 1.6% of their output each year poses three questions:1.  The ideal load factors derived from these wind speeds ignore a number of factors that will reduce the actual output attained by a wind farm at the given location and hub height.  The aim of our method was to use NASA modelled wind speed data as a predictor for the monthly energy output of wind farms.\n",
      "Ageing is a fact of life.  Just as with conventional forms of power generation, the energy produced by a wind farm gradually decreases over its lifetime, perhaps due to falling availability, aerodynamic performance or conversion efficiency.  Understanding these factors is however complicated by the highly variable availability of the wind.  This paper reveals the rate of ageing of a national fleet of wind turbines using free public data for the actual and theoretical ideal load factors from the UK's 282 wind farms.  Actual load factors are recorded monthly for the period of 2002-2012, covering 1686 farm-years of operation.  Ideal load factors are derived from a high resolution wind resource assessment made using NASA data to estimate the hourly wind speed at the location and hub height of each wind farm, accounting for the particular models of turbine installed.  By accounting for individual site conditions we confirm that load factors do decline with age, at a similar rate to other rotating machinery.  Wind turbines are found to lose 1.6 ± 0.2% of their output per year, with average load factors declining from 28.5% when new to 21% at age 19.  This trend is consistent for different generations of turbine design and individual wind farms.  This level of degradation reduces a wind farm's output by 12% over a twenty year lifetime, increasing the levelised cost of electricity by 9%.  Highlights:  The output of 282 wind farms is accurately estimated using public wind speed data.  Correcting for variability in the weather allows wind turbine ageing to be studied.  Onshore wind farm output falls 16% a decade, possibly due to availability and wear.  Performance decline with age is seen in all farms and all generations of turbines.  Decreasing output over a farm's life increases the levelised cost of electricity.\n",

      "Summary for Single deletions in mitochondrial DNA - Molecular mechanisms and disease phenotypes in clinical practice: In 1988 Holt et al. identified a deleted mtDNA subpopulation in skeletal muscle but not blood in nine patients with mitochondrial myopathy.  Single large-scale deletions of mtDNA were the first mtDNA genetic defects to be described and associated with human mitochondrial disorders [21].  Each mitochondrial nucleoid appears to contain a single mtDNA molecule.  However, normal OXPHOS enzyme activities may be observed in the muscle of patients with single mtDNA deletions; therefore, genetic analysis should be performed if there is clinical suspicion of a single mtDNA disorder, regardless of the biochemical findings.  This observation, taken together with ongoing research examining the role the mitochondrial nucleoid plays in mtDNA distribution, is likely to be important in unravelling the cause of extreme tissue segregation seen in mtDNA deletion disorders.  Table 1 outlines the potentially wide range of different clinical settings in which mitochondrial disease caused by single deletions of mtDNA enters into the differential diagnosis.  Single mtDNA deletions usually involve several genes, including at least one tRNA, so that global mitochondrial protein synthesis is affected.  KSS is most commonly associated with single large-scale deletions of mtDNA [56].  However, one third of patients harbour a common 4977bp mtDNA deletion [44,47,48].\n",
      "Over 20years ago single clonal deletions were the first mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genetic defects described in association with human disease.  Since then very large numbers of children and adults harbouring such deletions have been described and it is clear they are an important cause of human mitochondrial disease.  However, there still remain many important challenges in relation to our understanding of mechanisms leading to deletion formation and propagation and in relation to the factors determining the complex and varying relationship between genotype and clinical phenotype.  Although multidisciplinary team care is essential and can improve quality of life and outcomes for patients, a definitive molecular treatment for single mtDNA deletions remains an important translational research goal.  Patients with mtDNA deletions exhibit a very wide range of different clinical phenotypes with marked variation in age at onset and disease severity.  Single mtDNA deletions may enter into the differential diagnosis of many different paediatric and adult presentations across a wide range of medical specialties, although neurological presentations are amongst the most common.  In this review, we examine the molecular mechanisms underpinning mtDNA replication and we consider the hypotheses proposed to explain the formation and propagation of single large-scale mtDNA deletions.  We also describe the range of clinical features associated with single mtDNA deletions, outline a molecular diagnostic approach and discuss current management including the role of aerobic and resistance exercise training programmes.\n",

      "Summary for Short-term metabolic and growth responses of the cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa to ocean acidification: To this end, respiration and net calcification rates were calculated in corals exposed to increased CO2 conditions every 7 days for a total period of 21 days.  For fragments in the control treatment at 380ppm, 9.5°C, pH 8.07 (Table 3), there was no significant change in respiration rates from Time Zero to 21 days.  For scleractinian corals (i.e. calcareous skeleton forming corals), many studies demonstrate a reduction in growth (net calcification rates) in response to ocean acidification (Gattuso et al., 1998; Kleypas and Langdon, 2006; Krief et al., 2010; Langdon and Atkinson, 2005; Marubini et al., 2003).  The respiration rates for coral fragments at Time Zero before fragments were exposed to experimental conditions was 23µmolO2g-1h-1.  This complements a 24-h study by Maier et al. (2012) and a longer-term experiment by Form and Riebesell (2012), where growth rates of L. pertusa did not significantly change under different CO2 conditions.  The stable net calcification rates reported in this study are in contrast to the reduced respiration in experimental fragments.  Respiration rates for L. pertusa documented in this study are higher than those reported by Dodds et al. (2007).  Following techniques from Smith and Key (1975), and Ohde and Hossain (2004) calcification rates were calculated in L. pertusa by measuring the change in seawater alkalinity in respiration chambers housing coral fragments for 4h.  Net calcification rates in L. pertusa are often highly variable, even within studies where fragments are collected from the same locale and time of year.  Net calcification rates as measured by the alkalinity anomaly technique and 14C uptake, did not differ between control and experimental fragments, even though experimental fragments were at a much lower aragonite saturation level (still>1).\n",
      "Cold-water corals are associated with high local biodiversity, but despite their importance as ecosystem engineers, little is known about how these organisms will respond to projected ocean acidification.  Since preindustrial times, average ocean pH has decreased from 8.2 to ~8.1, and predicted CO2 emissions will decrease by up to another 0.3 pH units by the end of the century.  This decrease in pH may have a wide range of impacts upon marine life, and in particular upon calcifiers such as cold-water corals.  Lophelia pertusa is the most widespread cold-water coral (CWC) species, frequently found in the North Atlantic.  Here, we present the first short-term (21 days) data on the effects of increased CO2 (750ppm) upon the metabolism of freshly collected L. pertusa from Mingulay Reef Complex, Scotland, for comparison with net calcification.  Over 21 days, corals exposed to increased CO2 conditions had significantly lower respiration rates (11.4±1.39 SE, µmolO2g-1tissuedryweighth-1) than corals in control conditions (28.6±7.30 SE µmolO2g-1tissuedryweighth-1).  There was no corresponding change in calcification rates between treatments, measured using the alkalinity anomaly technique and 14C uptake.  The decrease in respiration rate and maintenance of calcification rate indicates an energetic imbalance, likely facilitated by utilisation of lipid reserves.  These data from freshly collected L. pertusa from the Mingulay Reef Complex will help define the impact of ocean acidification upon the growth, physiology and structural integrity of this key reef framework forming species.\n",

      "Summary for Performance analysis of quantization-based approximation algorithms for precomputing the supported QoS: In this paper, we write the QoS parameter of a path and the constraints of a request as (cost,delay).  In two-dimensional scaling, the cost metric and delay metric are quantized by the same method.  If we use the logarithmic scaling method on cost, we get the approximated function in Fig. 5(a).  For example, in Fig. 2(b), the QoS parameter of the minimum cost path is (4,7), and the QoS parameter of the minimum delay path is (8,4).  We can see that the total distortion area of two-dimensional scaling depends on the number of the optimal representative points n.  In logarithmic scaling, the cost metric of each path is selected from {1,(1+δ),(1+δ)2,…,(1+δ)n,UB}, where n=max{j|((1+δ)j<UB)(j∈Z+)}.  Since any possible delay constraint is considered, this \"error\" is not a single cost deviation, but an area on the Cartesian plane.  The above example illustrates that cost deviation cannot sufficiently reflect the admission control ability of the algorithm, while the \"area\" does.  If we use uniform scaling, by setting δt=2δs, we can consider that the total number of quantized cost and delay values for two-dimensional scaling is the same as that for cost-scaling.  On the other hand, the total number of the cost and delay values taken by two-dimensional scaling reduces with the same rate as that of cost-scaling.  In this section, we first present an exact pseudo-polynomial algorithm for computing the supported QoS with an integer cost metric.\n",
      "Precomputation of the supported QoS is very important for internet routing.  By constructing routing tables before a request arrives, a packet can be forwarded with a simple table lookup.  When the QoS information is provided, a node can immediately know whether a certain request can be supported without launching the path finding process.  Unfortunately, as the problem of finding a route satisfying two additive constraints is NP-complete, the supported QoS information can only be approximated using a polynomial time mechanism.  A good approximation scheme should reduce the error in estimating the actual supported QoS.  Nevertheless, existing approaches which determine this error may not truly reflect the performance on admission control, meaning whether a request can be correctly classified as feasible or infeasible.  In this paper, we propose using a novel metric, known as distortion area, to evaluate the performance of precomputing the supported QoS.  We then analyze the performance of the class of algorithms that approximate the supported QoS through discretizing link metrics.  We demonstrate how the performance of these schemes can be enhanced without increasing complexity.  Our results serve as a guideline on developing discretization-based approximation algorithms.\n",

      "Summary for Phosphorus levels in croplands of the European Union with implications for P fertilizer use: Fertilizer doses have to be based on attainable yield and soil nutrient levels.  With regards to the comparison of P input (Fig. 6) and soil P level (Fig. 1) our results confirm the scientific evidence that high P fertilizer inputs with positive P balance will increase the concentrations in the soil (Cordell et al., 2009), and also provide an insight to the regional distribution of different P supply levels in the regions of the EU in relation to P input.  Unlike for P supply categories the estimation of input need of different regions of the EU results quite different patterns when based on the recommendation systems from Hungary (Antal et al., 1979) and the UK (DEFRA, 2010).  Threshold values of the two fertilizer recommendation systems (Hungary, UK) were used separately to establish plant available P categories for each soil samples from the LUCAS Topsoil Survey.  In the meanwhile the Hungarian P fertilizer input was only about 10% of the optimal calculated by the local system on the basis of soil P levels.  Second, plant available P levels were calculated for all LUCAS topsoil samples taken from agricultural land using the two different fertilizer recommendation methods: one from Hungary and one from the UK.  According to the Hungarian system there is a need for fertilizer P input in all regions but two (one in Finland and Sardinia) of the EU (Fig. 4b).  In this study we classified the P concentration of soil samples from the LUCAS topsoil survey based on measured Olsen-P levels using equal-sized data subsets by each 20 percentiles (i) and threshold values of two different fertilizer recommendation systems (ii and iii).  Plant available phosphorus levels were determined using two selected fertilizer recommendation systems: one from Hungary (Antal et al., 1979) one from the United Kingdom (DEFRA, 2010).  Although high levels of soil P are observed on areas with high input and high yields, like those in north-western Europe, according to the Hungarian system, high fertilizer doses on these areas are still needed to secure the required yield levels.  Knowing the different regional distribution of P supply levels in the European Union cannot only be of valuable input in assessing current soil nutrient supply in relation to food security (Lal, 2013) and in assessing the need for fertilizer input to soils in Europe (Schröder et al., 2011) but also be of great value for the study of soil P loss to the environment (Sharpley et al., 2002; Heathwaite et al., 2005).  Interestingly, the system of the UK, would not recommend additional fertilizer input on some of these areas of high P levels, e.g.  However, the correlation between yields and P levels in the NUTS2 regions of the EU (Pearson coefficient=0.4; both based on the UK and Hungarian systems) suggest strong, but not exclusive P dependency of yield.  P fertilizer requirement of croplands in the EU were calculated by the fertilizer recommendation systems of Hungary (Antal et al., 1979) and UK (DEFRA, 2012b).  However, considering the fact that the advisory system of the UK would discourage fertilizer use in some of the most fertile regions of the EU and recommends low input to the rest of the EU as well (Fig. 4a) we might well think that fertilizer statistics do not catch the exact figures of fertilizer consumption in the EU.  Our calculations to sum the total P fertilizer input need on croplands of the EU resulted quite different figures if based on the Hungarian and the UK systems.  Based on measured values from uniform soil tests we provided first time reliable figures of P levels in soils of the EU, also in relation to cropping needs.  This flexibility included choosing from 2 systems, the \"nutrient sufficiency recommendation system\" which is developed to provide a 90-95% maximum yield for the year, and the \"build maintenance fertility program\" based soil test values over a planned period of time, usually 4-8 years, for both immediate crop needs and build up levels to a non-limiting value (Leikam et al., 2003).\n",
      "Soil P supply and fertilizer need maps of the EU were elaborated for the first time.  Estimated annual P input need of the EU's agriculture is 3.85 million tons.  Plant available P in cropland soils follows climatic patterns and yield levels in the EU.  Regional P means vary largely but cases with high P levels are present in all regions.  Inconsistencies between advised and reported P fertilizer consumptions pointed out.  In the frame of the Land Use/Land Cover Area Frame Survey sampling of topsoil was carried out on around 22,000 points in 25 EU Member States in 2009 and in additional 2 Member States in 2012.  Besides other basic soil properties soil phosphorus (P) content of the samples were also measured in a single laboratory in both years.  Based on the results of the LUCAS topsoil survey we performed an assessment of plant available P status of European croplands.  Higher P levels can be observed in regions where higher crop yields can be expected and where high fertilizer P inputs are reported.  Plant available phosphorus levels were determined using two selected fertilizer recommendation systems: one from Hungary and one from the United Kingdom.  The fertilizer recommendation system of the UK does not recommend additional fertilizer use on croplands with highest P supply, which covers regions mostly in Belgium and the Netherlands.  According to a Hungarian advisory system there is a need for fertilizer P input in all regions of the EU.  We established a P fertilizer need map based on integrating results from the two systems.  Based on data from 2009 and 2012, P input demand of croplands in the European Union was estimated to 3,849,873 tons(P2O5)/year.  Meanwhile we found disparities of calculated input need and reported fertilizer statistics both on local (country) scale and EU level.  The first ever uniform topsoil P survey of the EU highlights the contradictions between soil P management of different countries of the Union and the inconsistencies between reported P fertilizer consumption and advised P doses.  Our analysis shows a status of a baseline period of the years 2009 and 2012, while a repeated LUCAS topsoil survey can be a useful tool to monitor future changes of nutrient levels, including P in soils of the EU.\n",

      "Summary for Grain boundary excess volume and defect annealing of copper after high-pressure torsion: From the mean value (Δl/l0)Stage B=(1.85±0.37)×10-4 of nine samples, an apparent grain boundary excess volume eGB′ of (0.58±0.13)×10-10m can be derived.  In the case of Ni with elongated crystallites (item ii), nearly identical values of eGB=0.35×10-10 and 0.32×10-10m were found for the dilatometric measuring directions perpendicular to and parallel to the crystallite elongation, respectively, which confirms the attribution of the length change in stage B to grain boundaries [9].  One of the two samples served as a reference and was made from the same Cu material, which was well annealed and coarse grained (grain size >100μm).  Fig. 2 shows a typical dilatometric length contraction Δl/l0, indicating the annealing out of defects associated with the release of free volume upon linear heating of the HPT-deformed Cu sample.  This value of γ is typical of relaxed grain boundaries in Cu (see Ref.  As any relaxation processes of the SPD-generated grain boundaries should be finished at the elevated temperatures of stage B, these values of the excess volume can be considered as characteristic values for grain boundaries of polycrystalline Cu and Ni in general.  A complex defect annealing kinetics is suggested from volume and grain boundary diffusion studies in SPD-processed Cu and Ni [7,8].\n",
      "The release of excess volume upon recrystallization of ultrafine-grained Cu deformed by high-pressure torsion (HPT) was studied by means of the direct technique of high-precision difference dilatometry in combination with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and scanning electron microscopy.  From the length change associated with the removal of grain boundaries in the wake of crystallite growth, a structural key quantity of grain boundaries, the grain boundary excess volume or expansion eGB=(0.46±0.11)×10-10 m was directly determined.  The value is quite similar to that measured by dilatometry for grain boundaries in HPT-deformed Ni.  Activation energies for crystallite growth of 0.99±0.11 and 0.96±0.06eV are derived by Kissinger analysis from dilatometry and DSC data, respectively.  In contrast to Ni, substantial length change proceeds in Cu at elevated temperatures beyond the regime of dominant crystallite growth.  In the light of recent findings from tracer diffusion and permeation experiments, this is associated with the shrinkage of nanovoids at high temperatures.\n",

      "Summary for The effects of particle morphology on the analysis of discrete particle dispersion using Delaunay tessellation: In this article we explore the effect on the measured Area Disorder of two specific morphological properties: (1) the dispersion in particle sizes and (2) the aspect ratio of the particles.  At low aspect ratios, (relative to the area fraction) the particles behave particle-like and can be well described by disc/point particle theories.  From these we establish the reference HR model which has the equivalent area fraction, mean aspect ratio and number of particles.  Increasing the size disparity between the two particle populations, through using larger r2, enlarges the value of the Area Disorder, see Fig. 3a, with the effect of reducing the regularity in the arrangement of particles of the system.  Fig. 8 illustrates the micrographs used, and Table 2 tabulates the key statistics of the number of particles, mean and maximum aspect ratio and area fraction.\n",
      "Particle-reinforced composites and nanocomposites can contain a wide range of discrete particles, of various morphologies (e.g. spherical, fibre, and tube).  Two-dimensional micrographs of the material are used to assess whether the particles are well- or poorly-dispersed, but typically use the assumption that all particles are identical and spherical.  However we show, by considering elliptical particles, that the sizing and shapes of the discrete particles can change the overall appearance of the system, without the underlying mechanisms changing.  Thus our interpretation of particle dispersion is obtained by comparing our measurements to a reference system, which takes into account the particle morphologies, and demonstrates that discrepancies are brought on by oversimplification.\n",

      "Summary for The Ti/Al molar ratio as a new proxy for tracing sediment transportation processes and its application in aeolian events and sea level change in East Asia: Some samples containing Ti/Al ratios were collected from shore and marine sediments in the marginal seas off China (Fig. 2).  Recalculating data on the aerosol particles, collected in the East China Sea and Taiwan (Table 3), gives results consistent with a decrease in Ti/Al molar ratios during Asian Dust Storm episodes (Hsu et al., 2004, 2010).  The results of Ti/Al molar ratios show that most of the lake sediments (Fig. 2) have lower Ti/Al ratios than the surface sediments of dry land (100Ti/Al=3.06-3.77) (Fig. 1).  Comparing data from surface sediments and fluvial sediments (Fig. 1) with those from lake cores and marine sediments (Fig. 2) shows that sink areas are marked by lower Ti/Al molar ratios.  This study involves the spatial distribution of Ti/Al molar ratios in terrestrial and marine sediments in China and Taiwan.  Data show that most 100Ti/Al molar ratios fall between 3 and 4, except those at Sites 8 and 18.  Fig. 1 shows the spatial 100Ti/Al molar ratios of surface sediments, outcrops, aeolian sands, and fluvial sediments.  In Section 4.3, an investigation of the Kaoping River system shows how Ti/Al molar ratios are distributed in parent soils and fluvial sediments (Fig. 3).  In Table 1, molar ratios in sediments Ti/Al are expressed as 100Ti/Al.  To compare our data (Table 1) with those cited from other work (Table 2), 100 times Ti/Al molar ratios (100Ti/Al) are used in this study.  The Ti/Al molar ratios of land soils and outcrops tend to be higher than those on fluvial, estuary, lake and marine sediments.  In this study, the two samples of aeolian sand (Site 9 and Site 16) have very low 100Ti/Al molar ratios at 1.45 and 1.58 (see stars in Fig. 1 and grey row in Table 1).  Data on fluvial sediments from the Huanghe and Changjiang Rivers are from previous studies (Yang et al., 2002; Fan et al., 2001).  The 100Ti/Al molar ratios of aeolian sands are much lower than those of lake sediments and outcrops in situ.  This study also finds that Ti/Al molar ratios of deep sea sediments in the SCS are lower than those in shallow sea environments (Fig. 2).  In the case of the Kaoping River's drainage, Ti/Al molar ratios range between 2.50 and 3.89 in fluvial sediments (Fig. 3a), and between 2.73 and 3.94 in surface soils (Fig. 3b).  Most 100Ti/Al molar ratios fall in the range 3.06 and 3.77 in northern China and 2.43-2.80 in lake sediments.\n",
      "Ti/Al molar ratios of sediments declines during transportation.  Lake and pelagic sediments show relative low Ti/Al ratios.  The declined Ti/Al ratio in aerosol particles indicates Asian dust storm episode.  Ti/Al molar ratios of a deep marine core can estimate sea level changes.  Ti/Al molar ratios of sediments in various sedimentary environments are used to explain sediment transportation from source regions to sink areas.  Samples were collected from outcrops, soils, fluvial, lake, and marine sediment environments.  Initial Ti/Al molar ratios of sediments are controlled by those of parent soils or rocks.  These ratios tend to decline gradually as a result of heavy-mineral gravity fractionation during transportation.  Sedimentary Ti/Al molar ratios in sink areas such as lakes and pelagic environments are lower than those in source regions.  In this study, for the Changjiang River, Huanghe River, and Kaoping River, Ti/Al molar ratios decline considerably from downstream to estuary environments.  Additionally, well sorted aeolian sands have extremely low Ti/Al molar ratios in northern China.  The Ti/Al molar ratios of aerosol particles found in Taiwan and the East China Sea show reduced ratios as a result of Asia Dust Storm episodes.  Furthermore, lower Ti/Al molar ratios in deep ocean sediments were discovered by tracing the distribution of sedimentary Ti/Al molar ratios in the South China Sea.  When sea levels dropped during glacial periods, the river estuary was closer to deep marine areas and carried more terrestrial sediments into deep marine environments.  The closer estuary with relatively higher Ti/Al ratio would lead increase of Ti/Al molar ratios in deep sea sediments.  In this study, Ti/Al molar ratio is promoted as a new proxy to help with understanding changes in sedimentary environments.\n",

      "Summary for Synthesis, spectroscopic, coordination and biological activities of some organometallic complexes derived from thio-Schiff base ligands: The vibration frequencies and their tentative assignments for HLa-Maf and H2Lb-Daf ligands and their transition metal complexes are listed in Table 2.  The reaction of Schiff bases ligands with ruthenium(III), oxovanadium(IV) and dioxouranium(VI), affords a mono or binuclear complex of a cyclic or macrocyclic complexes, according to the mole ratio of metal to ligand.  The vibrational frequencies and tentative assignments for free HLa-Maf and H2Lb-Daf ligands and their transition metal complexes were recorded and are given in Table 2.  Reaction of the Schiff base ligand HLa-Maf with ruthenium(III), oxovanadium(IV) and dioxouranium(VI) ions in molar 1:1 and 2:1 afforded the corresponding stoichiometry transition metal complexes.  Electronic spectra of DMF solutions of the metal complexes were carried out by using UV-Vis Perkin-Elmer Model Lamda 900.  The electronic spectra of the ligands and their transition metal complexes in the solid state with their assignments, magnetic moment and molar conductivity measurement are given in Table 3.  Comparing the IR spectra of the complexes with the spectra of the free ligands elucidated the mode of binding of the Schiff bases to the metal ions.  Further evidence of the bonding is given by the observation of new bands in the spectra of the metal complexes of medium or weak intensity at the region 467-435cm-1 due to ν(MN) stretching vibrations supporting the involvement of the nitrogen atom of the azomethine group via coordination [38,39].  The physical and analytical data of the Schiff base ligands and their corresponding transition metal complexes are listed in Table 1.  It is possible to draw up the tentative structures of the transition metal complexes.  The electronic spectra of Ru(III) complexes 1, 4, 7 and 10 exhibit mainly three bands at the ranges, (352-432nm), (571-563nm) and (643-663nm), respectively.  On the other hand, mono and binuclear complexes for H2Lb-Daf were obtained in its binegative form in the molar ratio 1:1 and 1:2 (H2Lb-Daf: metal).  Additionally it has been observed that, dioxouranium(VI) complexes 3 and 12, exhibited two bands at 1384 and 852cm-1, respectively, due to the free nitrate [51,52].  The Schiff base, HLa-Maf and H2Lb-Daf and their metal complexes were evaluated for antimicrobial activity against one strain Gram-positive bacteria S. aureus and P. fluorescens as Gram-negative bacteria as well as one pathogenic fungus, as F. oxysporum The results of the biological studies of the ligand and the complexes are shown Table 5.  This is further supported by the band around 752-746cm-1 in the metal complexes due to ν(CS) and is inconsistent with the appearance of new weakly to medium bands in the region 356-382cm-1, which could be assigned to the stretching frequencies of ν(MS) bands, respectively, confirmed that, the chelation to the metal ions is achieved thiol-sulphur atoms [41].\n",
      "Thio Schiff base complexes derived from mono- and diacetyl ferrocene were synthesized.  The complexes are characterized by different spectroscopic techniques.  The complexes have different varieties of geometrical structures.  Biochemical studies were studied.  Two series of mono- and binuclear complexes cyclic or acyclic thio-ferocine Schiff base ligands, derived from the condensation of 2-aminobenzenthiol (L) with monoacetyl ferrocene in the molar ratio 1:1 or in the molar ratio 1:2 for diacetyl ferocine have been prepared.  The condensation reactions yield the corresponding Schiff Base ligands, HLa-Maf and H2Lb-Daf.  The chelation of the ligands to metal ions occurs through the sulfur of the thiol group as well as the nitrogen atoms of the azomethine group of the ligands.  HLa-Maf acts as monobasic bidentate or dibasic tetradentate, while H2Lb-Daf behaves as twice negatively cargend tetradentate ligand.  The structures of these ligands were elucidated by elemental analysis, infrared, ultraviolet-visible spectra, as well as 1H NMR spectra.  Reactions of the Schiff bases ligands with ruthenium(III), oxovanadium(IV) and dioxouranium(VI) afforded the corresponding transition metal complexes.  The properties of the newly prepared complexes were analyse by elemental analyses, infrared, electronic spectra, 1H NMR as well as the magnetic susceptibility and conductivity measurement.  The metal complexes exhibits different geometrical arrangements such as octahedral and square pyramidal coordination.  Schiff base ligands and their metal complexes were tested against two pathogenic bacteria as Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as one kind of fungi to study their biological activity.  All the complexes exhibit antibacterial and antifungal activities against these organisms.\n",

      "Summary for Chirality delivery through multiple and helical H-bonding from chiral coordination complex to its supramolecular architecture: Both of the chirality of the ligand and complex 1 have been confirmed by liquid circular dichroism (CD) studies (Fig. 3(a)).  We have studied the chirality delivery in the nucleotide-Cu(II) complex, [CuNa(GMP)(HGMP)(H2O)7]·6(H2O)·CH3OH (GMP=guanosine 5′-mono phosphate) [7a].  This negative CE demonstrates that the chiral of GMP delivers to GMP-Co(II) compounds and GMP mainly keeps the β-anomers in the complex.  To deliberate the chirality of the supramolecular architecture, solid state circular dichroism spectra were measured in a KCl matrix for GMP ligand and the single-crystals of complex 1 (Fig. 3(b)).  The chirality of GMP ligand was remained in the molecule of 1 and induced molecular chirality based on the distorted octahedral geometry of the Co(II) center.  The multiple and helical H-bonding along 2D layer is a distinctive way of chirality delivery in this work.  Herein, an alternative and unusual path of the chirality delivery in GMP-Co(II) complex, different from the path in the GMP-Cu(II) complex, has been investigated based on X-ray single crystal diffraction, liquid- and solid-state circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy.

      "Summary for NaFe0.5Co0.5O2 as high energy and power positive electrode for Na-ion batteries: Single phase and well-crystallized O3-type NaFe0.5Co0.5O2 is prepared by a solid-state method, and its electrode performance is compared in Na cells with NaFeO2 and NaCoO2.  When cut-off voltage is limited to 3.5V, NaFeO2 electrode shows approximately 100mAhg-1 of reversible capacity with nearly 3.3V flat voltage profile.  Available energy density is estimated to be 510mWhg-1 based on metallic sodium as positive electrode materials for rechargeable Na batteries.  The loss of reversible capacity is expected to be the degradation of electrolyte solution, especially in relation to the non-passivated surface of metallic sodium as a counter electrode [1].  On the basis of the material abundance in the Earth's crust, layered (alpha-type) NaFeO2, of which layer structure is also classified as \"O3-type\" following the Delmas' notation [4], is of the most interest from a perspective on both gravimetric and volumetric specific capacity as positive electrode materials for the Na batteries.  We demonstrate that the iron migration in O3-NaFeO2 is effectively suppressed by metal substitution for iron, therefore, sodium insertion/extraction reversibility and capacity of O3-type NaFe0.5Co0.5O2 are surprisingly higher than those of NaCoO2 and NaFeO2 with enhanced capacity retention and rate capability.  Recently, we revisited the layered NaFeO2 system and a systematic study was conducted to examine the electrode performance by changing the cut-off voltage in Na cells [7].  The most important finding of our article is that large reversible capacity and excellent rate-capability, which are clearly better than those of NaCoO2, are achieved on the basis of NaFeO2-derived sodium insertion materials.  When the cut-off voltage is limited to 3.4V in the sodium cells, NaFeO2 shows relatively good capacity retention with 80mAhg-1 of reversible capacity.  In NaFe1-yCoyO2 system, large initial capacity of approximately 160mAhg-1 is observed for NaFe0.4Co0.6O2 and NaFe0.6Co0.4O2 similar to NaFe0.5Co0.5O2.\n",
      "O3-type NaFeO2 is a promising candidate as positive electrode materials for rechargeable Na batteries.  However, its reversible range of sodium extraction is relatively narrow (x=ca.  0.4 in Na1-xFeO2) because of the irreversible structural change, presumably associated with the iron migration into the adjacent tetrahedral sites in Na layers as we recently reported.  Herein, we report that cobalt-substituted NaFeO2 demonstrates excellent electrode performance in a non-aqueous Na cell at room temperature.  NaFe0.5Co0.5O2 delivers approximately 160mAhg-1 of reversible capacity with relatively good capacity retention and excellent rate-capability in a voltage range of 2.5-4.0V, resulting in reversible formation of Na0.3Fe0.5Co0.5O2.  The partial substitution of metal element for Fe in O3-type NaFeO2-based materials is proved to be the important strategy to suppress the irreversible phase transition, and thus improving the reversibility of sodium removal/insertion as the electrode materials.  Synthesis and characterizations of layered NaFe0.5Co0.5O2.  Its electrode performance in Na cell was compared with those of NaFeO2 and NaCoO2.  NaxFe0.5Co0.5O2 is one of the highest power positive electrodes among layered oxides.\n",

      "Summary for Flow level detection and filtering of low-rate DDoS: The Congestion Participation Rate (CPR)-based approach proposed in this paper can detect single LDDoS attack flows.  In this section, we first propose the metric of CPR and then describe our CPR-based approach to detect and filter LDDoS attack flows.  This approach is expected to be deployed on a router where we want to detect and filter LDDoS attack flows.  As previously described, our CPR-based approach employs RED to actively drop packets from the pulsing LDDoS flows.  In this subsection, we conduct experiments to compare the effectiveness of our proposed CPR-based approach and the CAS approach [18] on detecting LDDoS attack flows under different categories of LDDoS attacks.  Table 3 shows that under DropTail, the CPR-based approach may not be able to distinguish an LDDoS attack flow from a normal TCP flow since the two CPRs are close to one another.  The the RED [11] mechanism enable our CPR-based approach to still be effective in detecting LDDoS attack flows in that very extreme scenario.  A CPR-based detection module is installed at router R0 where most normal TCP packets are dropped when an LDDoS attack is present.  This approach considers both the attack flows' characteristics and their influence on network traffic.  The third category describes the LDDoS attacks in which n flows start at the same time, and the burst rate of the aggregate attack flow is intensified n times.  Section 3 defines the metric of CPR, describes the CPR-based approach and analyzes the boundaries of average CPR for normal and attack flows.\n",
      "The recently proposed TCP-targeted Low-rate Distributed Denial-of-Service (LDDoS) attacks send fewer packets to attack legitimate flows by exploiting the vulnerability in TCP's congestion control mechanism.  They are difficult to detect while causing severe damage to TCP-based applications.  Existing approaches can only detect the presence of an LDDoS attack, but fail to identify LDDoS flows.  In this paper, we propose a novel metric - Congestion Participation Rate (CPR) - and a CPR-based approach to detect and filter LDDoS attacks by their intention to congest the network.  The major innovation of the CPR-base approach is its ability to identify LDDoS flows.  A flow with a CPR higher than a predefined threshold is classified as an LDDoS flow, and consequently all of its packets will be dropped.  We analyze the effectiveness of CPR theoretically by quantifying the average CPR difference between normal TCP flows and LDDoS flows and showing that CPR can differentiate them.  We conduct ns-2 simulations, test-bed experiments, and Internet traffic trace analysis to validate our analytical results and evaluate the performance of the proposed approach.  Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CPR-based approach is substantially more effective compared to an existing Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)-based approach - one of the most efficient approaches in detecting LDDoS attacks.  We also provide experimental guidance to choose the CPR threshold in practice.\n",

      "Summary for Analysis of Transcription Factors Key for Mouse Pancreatic Development Establishes NKX2-2 and MNX1 Mutations as Causes of Neonatal Diabetes in Man: In mice, hypomorphic mutations are associated with diabetes without evidence of exocrine deficiency (Oliver-Krasinski et al., 2009); we and others have shown that patients with less-severe homozygous missense mutations have neonatal diabetes with normal or mildly impaired exocrine function (De Franco et al., 2013; Nicolino et al., 2010).  For patients with homozygous mutations, their phenotype (both pancreatic and extrapancreatic) was compared with the phenotype of the knockout mouse for the same gene.  Finding inactivating mutations in patients with diabetes can establish the role of a gene in human pancreatic development and function.  The pancreatic phenotype is similar to the three previously reported patients with nonsense or frameshift mutations and the Ptf1a null mouse (Al-Shammari et al., 2011; Krapp et al., 1998; Sellick et al., 2004).  The aim of our study was to perform a comprehensive search for recessive mutations in genes encoding transcription factors known to be critical for pancreatic development in mice in a large collection of PNDM patients born to consanguineous parents.  Mutations causing a pancreatic/diabetes phenotype have not been found in man for many pancreatic transcription factors important for rodent pancreatic development, but there have been no large, systematic studies of these genes in appropriate patients to date.  For example, biallelic GCK mutations in humans cause permanent neonatal diabetes (PNDM), and mice lacking both copies of the gene have severe hyperglycemia at birth (Njølstad et al., 2001; Terauchi et al., 1995).  Our two patients with GLIS3 mutations, the six previous cases (Dimitri et al., 2011; Senée et al., 2006), and the Glis3 mouse knockout (Watanabe et al., 2009) all have neonatal diabetes diagnosed in the first week of life and congenital hypothyroidism.\n",
      "Understanding transcriptional regulation of pancreatic development is required to advance current efforts in developing beta cell replacement therapies for patients with diabetes.  Current knowledge of key transcriptional regulators has predominantly come from mouse studies, with rare, naturally occurring mutations establishing their relevance in man.  This study used a combination of homozygosity analysis and Sanger sequencing in 37 consanguineous patients with permanent neonatal diabetes to search for homozygous mutations in 29 transcription factor genes important for murine pancreatic development.  We identified homozygous mutations in 7 different genes in 11 unrelated patients and show that NKX2-2 and MNX1 are etiological genes for neonatal diabetes, thus confirming their key role in development of the human pancreas.  The similar phenotype of the patients with recessive mutations and mice with inactivation of a transcription factor gene support there being common steps critical for pancreatic development and validate the use of rodent models for beta cell development.  Analyzing a large collection of consanguineous patients with permanent neonatal diabetes, Flanagan et al. performed a comprehensive search for recessive mutations in transcription factors known to be critical for mouse pancreatic development.  They identify seven pancreatic transcription factors that cause neonatal diabetes, including NKX2-2 and MNX1.\n",

      "Summary for Efficient and adaptive congestion control for heterogeneous delay-tolerant networks: Between the three connectivity data traces, CafRep achieves lowest success ratio in the SF Cab traces [45] (48-44%) due to three reasons: first due to the SF Cab [45] topology described in Section 5.1, the social utility in CafRep cannot identify nodes that are significantly more central; second as the isolation periods are very high, the nodes cannot offload their content for a very long time; and third as the connectivity periods are very short, the publishing nodes that generate data at a constant rate cause increased dropped packets.  We proposed CafRep that uses a combined local social, buffer and delay metrics for congestion aware message forwarding and replication that maximises message delivery ratio and availability of nodes while minimising latency and packet loss rates at times of increasing congestion levels.  When congestion happens, the combined utility allows CafRep to de-cluster individual nodes and parts of the network by leveraging social metric with resource constraints.  As these nodes become overloaded, forwarding to a lower ranked node may lead to more even spread of the network load in the network and lower congestion rates, but also to increased number of intermediaries for the forwarded messages.  As discussed in Section 3, we believe that this higher cost for CafRep in SF Cab trace [45] comes from high weighting of ego network resources and social utility in a trace that does not have node connectivity with good pattern of regularity.  Sassy [44] trace is more challenging than Infocom 2006 because it does not include any infrastructure-like nodes (such as semi-static and static nodes such as those deployed during Infocom2006 [33]) that participate in forwarding, has significantly shorter connectivity durations and sparser network.  In this way, CafRep enables replication at different rates at different parts of the network that are dissimilar from each other and thus have different social and resource characteristics and patterns.  For SF traces [45], CafRep is significantly better than RR [38] and EBR [26] across all congestion levels.  It dynamically combines three types of implicit congestion heuristics: social (contact) driven heuristics that exploits contact relationships among nodes to allow optimal directionality and delivery probability of a node; node resource driven heuristics that aim to adopt to the nodes' buffer availability, delays and congesting rates; and ego network (regional) driven heuristics that aim to detect and adapt buffer availability, delays and congesting rates of different parts of the network.\n",
      "Detecting and dealing with congestion in delay-tolerant networks (DTNs) is an important and challenging problem.  Current DTN forwarding algorithms typically direct traffic towards more central nodes in order to maximise delivery ratios and minimise delays, but as traffic demands increase these nodes may become saturated and unusable.  We propose CafRep, an adaptive congestion aware protocol that detects and reacts to congested nodes and congested parts of the network by using implicit hybrid contact and resources congestion heuristics.  CafRep exploits localised relative utility based approach to offload the traffic from more to less congested parts of the network, and to replicate at adaptively lower rate in different parts of the network with non-uniform congestion levels.  We extensively evaluate our work against benchmark and competitive protocols across a range of metrics over three real connectivity and GPS traces such as Sassy [44], San Francisco Cabs [45] and Infocom 2006 [33].  We show that CafRep performs well, independent of network connectivity and mobility patterns, and consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art DTN forwarding algorithms in the face of increasing rates of congestion.  CafRep maintains higher availability and success ratios while keeping low delays, packet loss rates and delivery cost.  We test CafRep in the presence of two application scenarios, with fixed rate traffic and with real world Facebook application traffic demands, showing that regardless of the type of traffic CafRep aims to deliver, it reduces congestion and improves forwarding performance.\n",

      "Summary for Impact of temperature on CO2 storage at the Ketzin site based on fluid flow simulations and seismic data: There was no significant change in the values of the reservoir temperature at the observation well Ktzi202/2007 (Fig. 2) (Möller et al., 2012).  To demonstrate this we calculated the difference in Vp between both temperature scenarios present at the Ketzin site at the time of the 1st 3D seismic repeat campaign (Ivanova et al., 2012) using Gassmann's equations (1951) for 50% CO2 saturation.  In the Ivanova et al. (2012) study the impact of reservoir temperature on the mass estimation was not included.  Fig. 3 illustrates the dependence of CO2 density on pressure and temperature in the reservoir at Ketzin.  In order to investigate the impact of temperature in the reservoir on the 4D seismic data at the Ketzin site, the CO2 saturation and CO2 density, as well as the thickness of the CO2 layer obtained by multiphase fluid flow simulations were used as input to seismic modeling (see Section 2 of this paper).  Subsequently, CO2 mass estimations based on reservoir isothermal simulations for both temperature scenarios are compared to those obtained by in situ PNG logging (Ivanova et al., 2012).  Fig. 9 shows the resulting CO2 mass distribution maps for both temperature cases and reveals that they look similar to that from Ivanova et al. (2012).  By integrating seismic modeling and multiphase fluid flow simulations, we have estimated the impact of the reservoir temperature on the 4D seismic data from Ketzin.  Porosity was assumed to be constant in the reservoir (20%) for modeling the temperature effects on the seismic data.  We show this here by applying the method of volumetric estimation of Ivanova et al. (2012) to both the 34°C and 38°C reservoir temperature scenarios.  Both pressure and temperature increased due to the injection (Giese et al., 2009; Würdemann et al., 2010).  However, the volumetric estimation of the CO2 based on the 4D seismic data from Ketzin using results from the multiphase fluid flow simulations (Fig. 9) shows that the impact of temperature in the reservoir at the monitoring time is significant for these estimations.  Since the normalized root mean square (NRMS) differences in the 3D time-lapse data are greater than 10% (Kashubin et al., 2011) these temperature effects in the reservoir will not be resolvable with surface seismic methods at the Ketzin site.\n",
      "Seismic modeling demonstrates significant effects of CO2 on 4D seismic data (Ketzin).  CO2 saturation is insensitive to the reservoir temperature in Ketzin.  CO2 density is considerably lower for the higher reservoir temperature in Ketzin.  Qualitative impact of reservoir temperature is low on 4D seismic data from Ketzin.  Quantitative impact of temperature is considerable on 4D seismic data from Ketzin.  Temperature is one of the main parameters influencing the properties of CO2 during storage in saline aquifers since it along with pressure and co-constituents controls the phase behavior of the CO2/brine mixture.  When the CO2 replaces brine as a free gas it is well known to affect the elastic properties of porous media considerably.  In order to track the migration of geologically stored CO2 at the Ketzin site, 3D time-lapse seismic data were acquired by means of a baseline (pre-injection) survey in autumn 2005 and a first monitor survey in autumn 2009.  During this period the temperature in the storage reservoir near the injection well was observed to have increased from 34°C to 38°C.  This temperature increase led us to investigate the potential impact of temperature on the seismic response to the CO2 injection and on the CO2 mass estimations based on the Ketzin 4D seismic data.  Two temperature scenarios in the reservoir (34°C and 38°C) were studied using multiphase fluid flow modeling.  The simulations show that the impact of temperature on the seismic response is minor, but that the impact of the temperature on the CO2 mass estimations is significant and can, with the help of the multiphase fluid flow simulations, be explained mostly by the impact on the density of the CO2.\n",

      "Summary for The Sleipner storage site: Capillary flow modeling of a layered CO2 plume requires fractured shale barriers within the Utsira Formation: The model presented here differs significantly from earlier conceptual models of the storage site (e.g. Hellevang, 2006; Chadwick et al., 2008; Hermanrud et al., 2009, 2010) where researchers have assumed Darcy flow along a pressure gradient via holes in the shale barriers.  Two scenarios with identical geometry were tested by varying the threshold pressure of the shales within Utsira Formation: the first, a base case, assumed that the threshold pressure of approximately 1.6-1.9MPa measured in core recovered from Lower Seal shales (Springer and Lindgren, 2006) is applicable to all shale barriers within the model.  While a Darcy flow model requires a rising cascade of fluid through the sandstone and around the shales, via holes or breaks in the shale succession, the approach presented here suggests a simpler hypothesis: the vertical stacking of kilometer-wide and meter-thick CO2 layers that are the result of buoyant gas percolating through the vertical heterogeneity of sandstones and shales found in the Utsira Formation, in a similar manner to hydrocarbon migration and trap charge in petroleum systems, as appropriate for two-phase flow with a low capillary number (England et al., 1987).  The flow of CO2 within the storage site is then simulated with an invasion percolation simulator (Permedia, 2012), assuming percolation as a function of CO2 capillary pressure and shale threshold pressure.  The plume has encountered and breached eight shale barriers within the storage site: seven thin shales that are approximately 1-2m thick, and an uppermost thick shale that is 6-7m thick and geologically similar to the primary seal (Gregersen and Johannessen, 2001; Zweigel et al., 2004).  Percolation occurs when the threshold pressure of the shale barrier is exceeded by the buoyant gas capillary pressure of the trapped CO2 layer (Boettcher et al., 2002; Carruthers, 2003).  The only published laboratory measurements for the caprock threshold pressure (Springer and Lindgren, 2006; Harrington et al., 2009), from a cored production well, 15/9A-11, close to the storage site, suggest a range of 1.6-1.9MPa, i.e. the fluid pressure necessary for CO2 to break through a low permeability rock.  Evidence against such a fracture network is the continued lateral migration of the uppermost CO2 plume at about 1m per day to the north (Chadwick et al., 2008), and the lack of seismic velocity changes observed in the caprock above the storage site, and within the Middle Seal, on successive 4D seismic surveys (StatoilHydro, 2009; Chadwick et al., 2009).  The Sleipner storage site is not significantly stressed or overpressured at the present day (Wei et al., 1990); the pore fluids are effectively at hydrostatic pressure; and so for Sleipner, the fluid pressure increase necessary to fracture an intact seal (about 10MPa) is highly unlikely.  As such, above the storage site and inter-layering with it as the 7m thick shale, are the Lower Seal shales of the Nordland Group.  It seems reasonable that these regional findings for paleo-stress, pore pressure, and fluid flow also apply to the Sleipner storage site.  Considering the effect of ice on fluid pressure and stress on the underlying shale, the following scenario is hypothesized:  The question arises, has the caprock been fractured by the same deglaciation mechanism? And if so, do the observed chimney-like structures in the secondary seal within the vicinity of the storage site (Nicoll et al., 2012) contain vertical fracture networks that compromise the seal integrity? As yet, a percolation network of connected fractures through the much thicker shale sequences of the overburden has not been proven.  The flow modeling approach and analysis presented here suggest that the shale barriers have uncharacteristically low threshold pressures, enabling the rapid vertical migration of injected CO2 within the storage site.  The 3D model is calibrated by adjusting the breakthrough threshold pressures of the shales to match published estimates of layer thickness (column heights underlying shale barriers) and the areal distribution for trapped CO2 derived from 4D seismic.  To obtain multiple layers of CO2, these have either imposed a discrete vertical pathway to by-pass the thin shales within the Formation (Chadwick et al., 2006; Hermanrud et al., 2009, 2010) or assumed a convenient vertical juxtaposition of pre-existing holes (erosional or otherwise) for the eight intra-formational shale barriers.  The overlying Nordland Group, which extends from the top of the Utsira Formation to the seafloor, is predominantly shale (Fig. 1), and is expected to provide a caprock with a high threshold pressure, sufficient to seal the site and prevent leakage of the buoyant CO2 fluid over several millennia, i.e. the timescale required to offset climate change (Lindeberg and Bergmo, 2003).  This three-dimensional model consists of a geological framework of nine alternating intervals of sandstone and shale that extends from the base of the Utsira Formation below the injection point to the primary seal above the storage site.  This is considered to be a shallow depth setting for a storage environment (Chadwick et al., 2008) as the pressure and temperature conditions are likely to be close to the critical point above which CO2 becomes a more buoyant gas phase.  However, the fracturing of shales as a consequence of such small pressure changes within the Utsira Formation is highly unlikely.  Successive seismic reflection surveys of the Sleipner CO2 storage site have shown by observation that the plume of injected CO2 at the Sleipner storage site has a geometry which reveals partial trapping beneath thin shales within the Utsira Formation.\n",
      "Flow model for Sleipner with a plausible layering of CO2 plume and mass balance.  CO2 mass balance analysis for poor temperature and layer thickness constraints.  An unusual capillary flow model, not Darcy flow, results in a successful 3D model.  Low shale barrier threshold pressures indicate pervasive micro-fracturing.  Pre-CO2 fracturing hypothesis based on rapid melting of Pleistocene ice sheets.  To prevent ocean acidification and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, it is necessary to capture and store carbon dioxide.  The Sleipner storage site, offshore Norway, is the world's first and largest engineered waste repository for a greenhouse gas.  CO2 is separated from the Sleipner gas condensate field and stored in the pore space of the Utsira Formation, a saline aquifer approximately 1km below the surface and 200km from the coast.  Statoil, the field operator, has injected almost 1Mt/yr of captured CO2 into the storage site since 1996.  The buoyant CO2 plume ascended rapidly through eight thin shale barriers within the aquifer to reach the top seal in less than three years.  The plume's progress has been monitored by eight seismic surveys, as well as gravimetric and electromagnetic monitoring, which record the spreading of nine thin CO2 layers.  This paper presents a capillary flow model using invasion percolation physics that accurately matches the plume's geometry.  The approach differs from standard Darcy flow simulations, which fail to match the plume geometry.  The calibrated capillary flow simulation indicates that a mass balance for the plume is likely, but can only replicate the plume geometry if the thin intra-formational shale barriers are fractured.  The model enables an estimate of the shale barrier behavior and caprock performance.  The fractures are very unlikely to have been caused by CO2 injection given the confining stress of the rock and weak overpressure of the plume, and so fracturing must pre-date injection.  A novel mechanism is suggested: the deglaciation of regional ice sheets that have rapidly and repeatedly unloaded approximately 1km of ice.  The induced transient pore pressures are sufficient to hydro-fracture thin shales.  The fractures enable fast CO2 ascent, resulting in a multi-layered plume.  Shallow CO2 storage sites in the Northern North Sea and other regions that have been loaded by Quaternary ice sheets are likely to behave in a similar manner.\n",

Thawed cells were also able to survive and form aggregates in both static and dynamic suspension culture (Fig. 6a).  For in vitro assay, by simply replacing the entire E8 medium with differentiation medium of day-2 spinner flask suspension culture, BC1 and TNC1 aggregates transformed into EBs and started spontaneous differentiation under the stimulation of 10% serum (Supplementary Fig.  After treatment with ROCK inhibitor and dissociation, a single cell suspension of BC1 hiPSCs from feeder-free adhesion culture was directly inoculated into the spinner flask with 45ml of E8+Y27632.  We found that >98% of the cells are positive for TRA-1-60, SSEA4, NANOG, and OCT4 after 4days of culture by flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 3a).  Moreover, hiPSCs expanded in E8 feeder-free condition showed comparable potential to generate multiple hematopoietic lineages as hiPSCs expanded in MEF culture conditions in the standard colony-forming unit (CFU) assay (Yu et al., 2008; Zhan et al., 2004) (Supplementary Fig. S2c).  After 8days in spinner flask followed by 4days on gelatin-coated tissue culture plates in differentiation medium, cells of all three germ layers could be detected by immunofluorescent staining of specific markers (Fig. 5a).  Cells in AD-SF and UL-SF conditions showed 2-3-fold higher expansion rate in the first passage than hiPSCs that were directly thawed in spinner flasks (Fig. 6b).  Using the spin-EB method (Ng et al., 2008, 2005; Yu et al., 2008) in a feeder- and serum-free condition, we found that on day 14, ~25%-80% of the differentiating hiPSCs were CD34+CD45+ characteristic of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) (Supplementary Fig.  For iPSCs maintained in suspension in spinner flasks, cell aggregates were washed, and the entire medium was changed from E8 to differentiation medium to induce transformation from cell aggregates to EBs on day 3 after passaging.  For recovery from frozen stock, the cells were thawed by following standard cell culture protocol.  To support a robust production of hiPSCs from the bench to a clinical setting, we sought to adapt the cells directly from feeder-free adhesion culture to dynamic suspension culture in spinner flasks.  BC1 cells expanded in static suspension in E8 medium with an average rate of 3.7±0.9 fold per passage, 3.7×106 fold increase in total with >99% of the cells being TRA-1-60+ after 13 passages (Fig. 1b,c).\n",
      "Large-scale production of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) by robust and economic methods has been one of the major challenges for translational realization of hiPSC technology.  Here we demonstrate a scalable culture system for hiPSC expansion using the E8 chemically defined and xeno-free medium under either adherent or suspension conditions.  To optimize suspension conditions guided by a computational simulation, we developed a method to efficiently expand hiPSCs as undifferentiated aggregates in spinner flasks.  Serial passaging of two different hiPSC lines in the spinner flasks using the E8 medium preserved their normal karyotype and expression of undifferentiated state markers of TRA-1-60, SSEA4, OCT4, and NANOG.  The hiPSCs cultured in spinner flasks for more than 10 passages not only could be remained pluripotent as indicated by in vitro and in vivo assays, but also could be efficiently induced toward mesodermal and hematopoietic differentiation.  Furthermore, we established a xeno-free protocol of single-cell cryopreservation and recovery for the scalable production of hiPSCs in spinner flasks.  This system is the first to enable an efficient scale-up bioprocess in completely xeno-free condition for the expansion and cryopreservation of hiPSCs with the quantity and quality compliant for clinical applications.  We report the first suspension culture of hiPSCs using E8 medium.  We report the first hydrodynamic model for glass-ball type spinner flasks.  We establish a scalable bioprocess in completely defined xeno-free conditions.  We optimized a single-cell cryopreservation for hiPSCs in suspension.  Human iPSCs maintained pluripotency and normal karyotype along the bioprocess.\n",

      "Summary for Generation of familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy-specific induced pluripotent stem cells: As with iPS cells designed to be specific for other diseases, iPS cells generated from patients who were heterozygous for FAP are more useful for elucidating the pathogenesis of FAP: TTR and ATTR in heterozygous FAP form heterotetramers, which produce amyloid, and recombinant TTR forms a homotetramer, which is a totally different form of TTR in plasma and tissues.  Moreover, LC-MS/MS analysis clearly showed that hepatocyte-like cells differentiated from FAP-specific iPS cells indeed expressed both ATTR Val30Met and wild-type TTR at protein level and the ratio of TTR protein to ATTR protein is approximately 1 to 1 in the D20 culture supernatant (Fig. 5B).  The amount of TTR protein was approximately 2.28μg/ml (Fig. 4C), which is comparable with the previous result (0.2-2μg/ml) in functional hepatocyte-like cells differentiated from normal iPS cells (Sullivan et al., 2010), and exhibits 50 times higher than the previous result (0.034-0.057μg/ml) in human hepatocytes in primary culture (Wigmore et al., 1997).  SeV vectors are slowly diluted and disappear during iPS cell division, and SeV vector-positive cells can be removed by means of an anti-SeV-HN antibody (Fusaki et al., 2009).  Moreover, with the temperature-sensitive SeV vector used in this study, vectors, even if present, could easily be removed after the temperature shift treatment and would not be reactivated in iPS cells (Ban et al., 2011).  The concentration of TTR protein in the media of differentiated FAP-specific iPS cells was measured by ELISA assay.  The approximate concentration of TTR protein in the media of differentiated FAP-specific iPS cells was approximately 2.28μg/ml (Fig. 4C).  FAP-specific iPS cells indeed differentiated into hepatocyte-like cells (Shiraki et al., 2008; Shiraki et al., 2011) and expressed Val30Met ATTR.  Extraction of RNA from HepG2 cells and the frozen samples of livers from FAP patients A002 and cDNA synthesis were performed as previously described (Fusaki et al., 2009).  In addition, the PCR-RFLP method showed that hepatocyte-like cells differentiated from FAP-specific iPS cells indeed expressed ATTR Val30Met and wild-type TTR mRNA, similar to expression in the liver of the FAP patient from whom FAP-specific iPS cells were generated (Fig. 5A).  The ratio of expression of TTR protein to ATTR protein varies among cells.  Induction of human iPS cells was performed as described previously (Fusaki et al., 2009; Ban et al., 2011).\n",
      "Familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) is a hereditary amyloidosis induced by amyloidogenic transthyretin (ATTR).  Because most transthyretin (TTR) in serum is synthesized by the liver, liver transplantation (LT) is today the only treatment available to halt the progression of FAP, even though LT is associated with several problems.  Despite the urgent need to develop alternatives to LT, the detailed pathogenesis of FAP is still unknown; also, no model fully represents the relevant processes in patients with FAP.  The induction of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells has allowed development of pluripotent cells specific for patients and has led to useful models of human diseases.  Because of the need for a tool to elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of FAP, in this study we sought to establish heterozygous ATTR mutant iPS cells, and were successful, by using a Sendai virus vector mixture containing four transcription factors (Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc) to reprogram dermal fibroblasts derived from FAP patients.  Moreover, FAP-specific iPS cells had the potential to differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells and indeed expressed ATTR.  FAP-specific iPS cells demonstrated the possibility of serving as a pathological tool that will contribute to understanding the pathogenesis of FAP and development of FAP treatments.  We established, for the first time, FAP-specific iPS cells by using a Sendai virus.  FAP-specific iPS cells have potential to differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells.  Hepatocyte-like cells from FAP-specific iPS cells indeed expressed ATTR Val30Met.  FAP-specific iPS cells demonstrate the possibility to serve as a pathological tool.\n",

      "Summary for Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Models of Progranulin-Deficient Frontotemporal Dementia Uncover Specific Reversible Neuronal Defects: PGRN secretion from these cells was also ∼50% lower than in control and sporadic FTD cells (Figures S3C and S3D).  GRN mRNA levels were similar in cells from the control subject and sporadic FTD patient (Figure 3A), but in cells from the FTD patient with the PGRN S116X mutation, the mRNA level was only ∼30% of that found in the control (Figure 3A).  Upon differentiation, GRN mRNA levels were ∼41% lower in PGRN S116X neurons than in control and sporadic FTD neurons differentiated from multiple iPSC lines (Figure 3D).  Most cells in culture were capable of inducing tetrodotoxin-sensitive action potentials (control: 79.2%; PGRN S116X: 75%), which is consistent with the finding that ∼80% of cells are MAP2-positive neurons (Figure 2G).  This cellular defect appears to be PGRN-independent since PGRN expression levels are normal in sporadic FTD neurons.  Consistent with the results of the cell viability assay, PGRN S116X neurons showed greater caspase-3 activation in response to staurosporine than control or sporadic FTD neurons, whereas tunicamycin increased caspase-3 activity in both PGRN S116X and sporadic FTD neurons (Figure 4D).  The decreased cell viability (Figure 4E) in staurosporine-treated PGRN S116X neurons was rescued by PGRN expression.  Approximately 40% of the MAP2+ cells were presumably glutamatergic and expressed VGLUT1 (Figure 2H), and <10% of cells were GABA+ inhibitory neurons or tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)+ dopaminergic neurons (Figures 2I and 2J).  Data analysis was aimed at characterizing the gene expression differences between neurons from a sporadic FTD subject and a carrier the PGRN S116X mutation compared to neurons derived from one normal control.  Among the top downregulated genes in PGRN S116X neurons (but not in control or sporadic FTD neurons) was the ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-2 (RPS6KB2; Figure 4H).  Correspondingly, PGRN S116X iPSCs secreted 50% less PGRN than iPSCs from the control subject and sporadic FTD patient (Figure 3C).\n",
      "The pathogenic mechanisms of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) remain poorly understood.  Here we generated multiple induced pluripotent stem cell lines from a control subject, a patient with sporadic FTD, and an FTD patient with a novel heterozygous GRN mutation (progranulin [PGRN] S116X).  In neurons and microglia differentiated from PGRN S116X induced pluripotent stem cells, the levels of intracellular and secreted PGRN were reduced, establishing patient-specific cellular models of PGRN haploinsufficiency.  Through a systematic screen of inducers of cellular stress, we found that PGRN S116X neurons, but not sporadic FTD neurons, exhibited increased sensitivity to staurosporine and other kinase inhibitors.  Moreover, the serine/threonine kinase S6K2, a component of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, was specifically downregulated in PGRN S116X neurons.  Both increased sensitivity to kinase inhibitors and reduced S6K2 were rescued by PGRN expression.  Our findings identify cell-autonomous, reversible defects in patient neurons with PGRN deficiency, and provide a compelling model for studying PGRN-dependent pathogenic mechanisms and testing potential therapies.  Progranulin (PGRN) mutations are a common cause of frontotemporal dementia, but the underlying molecular mechanism is unknown.  Gao and colleagues now generate multiple frontotemporal dementia patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell lines and establish a human neuronal model of PGRN haploinsufficiency.  Studies on human postmitotic neurons derived from these lines reveal cell-autonomous and reversible defects in specific signaling pathways that are compromised in PGRN-deficient neurons and establish a model system for studying PGRN-dependent pathogenic mechanisms and testing potential therapies.\n",

      "Summary for Specification of Functional Cranial Placode Derivatives from Human Pluripotent Stem Cells: Induction of cranial placode markers was observed by day 5 with FOXG1 preceding expression of SIX1 and DLX3 (Figure 1H).  By day 11, placode clusters were negative for PAX6 but retained expression of TFAP2A (Figure 5B), suggesting that early anterior PAX6+ preplacode cells give rise to PAX6-negative posterior placode populations enriched for PAX3+.  Using the placode induction protocol (PIP) >70% of all cells adopt a SIX1+ cranial placode precursor fate by day 11 of differentiation.  Our findings further delineate the time point of developmental commitment to placodal fate by day 7, given that treatment of cells at day 7 of differentiation (preplacode) induced a switch between various placode fates but did not affect the ratio of cells of placode versus nonneural ectoderm fate.  OVOL2 was enriched during PIP by day 5 of differentiation, and placode clusters showed strong immunoreactivity for OVOL2 (Figure 2H).  To quantify the induction of lens placode fate, we monitored expression of the lens precursor marker PITX3 at day 16 of differentiation (Figure S6B).  We also observed very few (<1%) NC lineage cells under PIP conditions based on SOX10 expression by immunocytochemistry and SOX10::GFP (Chambers et al., 2012; Mica et al., 2013) reporter line expression (Figure S1F).  In hESC-derived placode, we observed an 8-fold increase in the percentage of cells with enhancer activity in PIP versus N-SB (Figure S1K).  Expression of BRN3A confirmed the sensory neuron identity of the cells (Figure S5G).  For example, exposure of preplacode cells to FGF8 enriches for ASCL1 expression compatible with olfactory placode fate (Balmer and LaMantia, 2005).  We next tested whether putative preplacode cells can be coaxed into specific placode fates other then trigeminal neurons.  At day 5, 2 days following Noggin withdrawal (PIP), there was an increase in the number of TFAP2A+ cells (Figure 5B) under PIP conditions and a concomitant loss of TFAP2A+ cells in N-SB (Figure 5C).\n",
      "Cranial placodes are embryonic structures essential for sensory and endocrine organ development.  Human placode development has remained largely inaccessible despite the serious medical conditions caused by the dysfunction of placode-derived tissues.  Here, we demonstrate the efficient derivation of cranial placodes from human pluripotent stem cells.  Timed removal of the BMP inhibitor Noggin, a component of the dual-SMAD inhibition strategy of neural induction, triggers placode induction at the expense of CNS fates.  Concomitant inhibition of fibroblast growth factor signaling disrupts placode derivation and induces surface ectoderm.  Further fate specification at the preplacode stage enables the selective generation of placode-derived trigeminal ganglia capable of in vivo engraftment, mature lens fibers, and anterior pituitary hormone-producing cells that upon transplantation produce human growth hormone and adrenocorticotropic hormone in vivo.  Our results establish a powerful experimental platform to study human cranial placode development and set the stage for the development of human cell-based therapies in sensory and endocrine disease.  Cranial placodes are essential for the development of sensory and endocrine organs.  Here, Studer and colleagues report the efficient derivation of cranial placodes from human pluripotent stem cells.  They demonstrate how to obtain specific placode derivatives such as trigeminal ganglia capable of in vivo engraftment, mature lens fibers, and anterior pituitary cells capable of producing human GH and ACTH in vivo.  Their results establish a platform for studying human cranial placode development and for applications of placode derivatives in regenerative medicine.\n",

      "Summary for Phialemonium infection complicating chronic suppurative otitis media: Late in the disease course a CWD tympanomastoidectomy was warranted after the patient continued to experience otorrhea, severe otalgia, residual cholesteatoma foci and repeated Phialemonium cultures.  Phialemonium species was first cultured from an otorrhea swab nearly 3 years after initial presentation (day 1135).  We describe a confined local Phialemonium infection in the tympanomastoid cavity without any systemic manifestations.  Initially the Phialemonium infection was treated with topical anti-fungal therapy; systemic anti-fungal were added.\n",

      "Summary for Reorganisation of brain networks in frontotemporal dementia and progressive supranuclear palsy: For example, in young adults with a roving oddball paradigm, Garrido et al. (2008, 2009b) found that the most likely network had bidirectional frontal-temporal connections, with connectivity modulated by the difference between the standard and deviant tones.  However, neurodegeneration not only weakens specific network connections, but can also lead to reorganisation of the networks by enhancing connectivity among the relatively unaffected regions (Seeley et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2010).  The comparison of model evidences did not distinguish between bvFTD and PSP, at either the family level of network architecture, or at the level of modulation of connections in response to change detection.  In the first model for each of the patient groups the global ACE-r score was entered as the dependent variable and the predictor variables included the mean amplitude of the MMNm (collapsed across deviant types) and the frontal, temporal and parietal interhemispheric connectivity measures from the most likely 'partial' network model.  The similar patterns of network connectivity in bvFTD and PSP might be explained by the partially overlapping profiles of prefrontal cortical atrophy and dysfunction in both diseases, despite diverse patterns of underlying neuropathology (Josephs et al., 2006; Mackenzie et al., 2011; Rohrer et al., 2011; Seelaar et al., 2011), although the atrophy is less severe in the frontal lobes of PSP than bvFTD.  The change in connectivity, from the sparse network model observed in health to a more distributed network in the patient groups, has two aspects of particular interest.  In contrast, both patient groups were associated with a very different network model as the most likely, given the observed data.  Specifically, since bvFTD and PSP have prefrontal neuropathology, we predicted that network reorganisation would lead to more distributed networks with enhanced connectivity among the less affected parietal regions.  (Coull et al., 2011) which may explain the delayed response in bvFTD to this specific deviant type, considering the greater extent of frontal atrophy in these patients.  Secondly, we examined how the most likely network was modulated in response to the deviant vs standard tones.  Despite the similarities in the changes of network connectivity, differences between the groups were revealed in the evoked responses measured at the auditory cortex.  A key challenge to understanding the effects of neurodegeneration is to characterise the changing patterns of brain network connectivity, in response to both the disease and its treatment (Pievani et al., 2011; Seeley et al., 2009; Warren et al., 2012).  Dynamic causal modelling also incorporates the modulatory effects of experimental manipulations on connections, such as the difference between standard and deviant stimuli, providing evidence of the critical connections for change detection (Kiebel et al., 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009).\n",
      "The disruption of large-scale brain networks is increasingly recognised as a consequence of neurodegenerative dementias.  We assessed adults with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and progressive supranuclear palsy using magnetoencephalography during an auditory oddball paradigm.  Network connectivity among bilateral temporal, frontal and parietal sources was examined using dynamic causal modelling.  We found evidence for a systematic change in effective connectivity in both diseases.  Compared with healthy subjects, who had focal modulation of intrahemispheric frontal-temporal connections, the patient groups showed abnormally extensive and inefficient networks.  The changes in connectivity were accompanied by impaired responses of the auditory cortex to unexpected deviant tones (MMNm), despite normal responses to standard stimuli.  Together, these results suggest that neurodegeneration in two distinct clinical syndromes with overlapping profiles of prefrontal atrophy, causes a similar pattern of reorganisation of large-scale networks.  We discuss this network reorganisation in the context of other focal brain disorders and the specific vulnerability of functional brain networks to neurodegenerative disease.  We compare two distinct neurodegenerative syndromes with prefrontal atrophy.  We show both diseases impair the automatic detection of change (MMNm).  Using DCM we discover that both diseases lead to similar network reorganisation.  We suggest principled network reorganisation in response to prefrontal degeneration.\n",

      "Summary for Frontal and superior temporal auditory processing abnormalities in schizophrenia: Replicating findings from our prior study that used single dipole source localization to examine STG activity (Smith et al., 2010) and now examining a new sample using a different MEG system and applying distributed source localization methods, reduced S1 STG activity was observed in SZ, again supporting impaired encoding of auditory information.  In addition, in a review of 100ms auditory studies Rosburg et al. (2008) concluded that medication did not seem to account for group differences in N100 activity.  Boutros et al. (2011) also observed 100ms auditory activity in middle temporal gyrus, parietal, cingulate, and occipital regions.\n",
      "Although magnetoencephalography (MEG) studies show superior temporal gyrus (STG) auditory processing abnormalities in schizophrenia at 50 and 100ms, EEG and corticography studies suggest involvement of additional brain areas (e.g., frontal areas) during this interval.

      "Summary for Combined analysis of sMRI and fMRI imaging data provides accurate disease markers for hearing impairment: Fig. 7 shows the top 10 functional features extracted from fMRI data that differentiate the HI and NH groups.  In this way, we represented each subject as a 972-dimension feature vector, including 969 features from the contrast maps after hierarchical clustering and 3 binary features from sedation method.  In the analysis of sMRI data, image features were selected based on their likelihood scores.  Though this explanation is speculative, it could explain why features B, C, E, F, G, H, and I seem to be more important in separating the HI and NH groups of infants based on brain activation during fMRI.  For sMRI images, we used SIFT features to represent the brain images and developed an algorithm to analyze the SIFT features.  The SIFT features from sMRI images and region-level features from fMRI images are much less sensitive to registration errors when compared to voxel-features.  Specifically, we employed the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm to detect and describe local features in sMRI and extracted region-level features to represent the functional contrast maps.  Due to the high density of SIFT features in the brain images and the pair-wise comparison among SIFT features required in a later step, analyzing the 3D brain image as a whole is computationally infeasible.  Different choices of likelihood threshold for the sMRI feature selection resulted in different numbers of selected features and therefore different classification accuracies.  In this study, we employed the SIFT algorithm to extract SIFT features from brain structural MR images, and devised an approach for the automatic classification of NH vs. HI based on the SIFT features.  For a new SIFT feature from a brain image whose class-label is unknown, the corresponding SVM is expected to be able to predict the class label of this new SIFT feature without finding its similar feature set in the huge amount of SIFT features extracted from the brain images used for training.  Inspecting the most important features that differentiate children born with hearing impairment from children with normal hearing in this study, we see some features that are in line with hypotheses about under stimulation of auditory function in HI infants; while other observations already begin to add to our knowledge of how congenital deafness affects brain development and function.  The second step for feature evaluation was to assign likelihood scores to the SIFT features.  In feature selection, these two ROIs were treated as different features and selected interchangeably.  Based upon the extracted features, SVM classifiers were trained to separate HI from NH.  In Results, we compare the classification performance of the sMRI classifier, the fMRI classifier and the combined classifier, and assess the stability of feature selection as well as the discriminatory power of features.  For sMRI, however, each training sample has a set of SIFT features, which can be treated as a set of words included in an article.  While traditional methods utilize voxel-based morphometric (VBM) features, in which each single voxel serves as an independent feature, we extracted high-level features to characterize the 3D images.  The first step was to find all the other features that were similar to the feature that was being analyzed.  For the evaluation of a feature, we only calculated its distance to the other features in the same cube.\n",
      "In this research, we developed a robust two-layer classifier that can accurately classify normal hearing (NH) from hearing impaired (HI) infants with congenital sensori-neural hearing loss (SNHL) based on their Magnetic Resonance (MR) images.  Unlike traditional methods that examine the intensity of each single voxel, we extracted high-level features to characterize the structural MR images (sMRI) and functional MR images (fMRI).  The Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm was employed to detect and describe the local features in sMRI.  For fMRI, we constructed contrast maps and detected the most activated/de-activated regions in each individual.  Based on those salient regions occurring across individuals, the bag-of-words strategy was introduced to vectorize the contrast maps.  We then used a two-layer model to integrate these two types of features together.  With the leave-one-out cross-validation approach, this integrated model achieved an AUC score of 0.90.  Additionally, our algorithm highlighted several important brain regions that differentiated between NH and HI children.  Some of these regions, e.g.  planum temporale and angular gyrus, were well known auditory and visual language association regions.  Others, e.g.  the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), were not necessarily expected to play a role in differentiating HI from NH children and provided a new understanding of brain function and of the disorder itself.  These important brain regions provided clues about neuroimaging markers that may be relevant to the future use of functional neuroimaging to guide predictions about speech and language outcomes in HI infants who receive a cochlear implant.  This type of prognostic information could be extremely useful and is currently not available to clinicians by any other means.  We probe brain structural and functional changes in hearing impaired (HI) infants.  We build a robust two-layer classifier that integrates sMRI and fMRI data.  This integrated model accurately separates HI from normal infants (AUC 0.9).  Our method detects important brain regions different between HI and normal infants.  Our method can include diverse types of data and be applied to other diseases.\n",

      "Summary for Genetic Correction of Tauopathy Phenotypes in Neurons Derived from Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells: Importantly, the mutation-related increase in TAU fragmentation in human iPSC-derived neurons was confirmed by western blotting with three different TAU antibodies (TAU-5, TAU-A12, and TAU-C17 that recognize the central core, N terminus, and C terminus of the protein, respectively) (Carmel et al., 1996; Porzig et al., 2007) and was decreased dramatically upon genetic correction of the mutation (Figures 4D-4I).  Upon neuronal differentiation of the parental TAU-152A/T-iPSCs (Chambers et al., 2009; Hu and Zhang, 2009; Ring et al., 2012), immunocytochemical analysis of TAU revealed unhealthy looking neurons with punctate TAU staining in neuronal processes (Figure 3E).  Most strikingly, there was a mutant gene-dose-dependent increase in caspase-cleaved TAU fragments, as determined by the caspase-cleaved TAU-specific antibody C3 (Gamblin et al., 2003; Guillozet-Bongaarts et al., 2005), in neurons derived from the isogenic TAU-A152T-iPSCs (Figures 4J and 4K).  The TAU-A152T mutation is the first to show the association of a TAU mutation with increased risks for FTD, PSP, and AD (Coppola et al., 2012).  Genetic correction of the mutation in the isogenic TAU-152A/A-iPSCs abolished the neurodegenerative phenotype, leading to the generation of healthy looking neurons with smooth TAU and MAP2 staining (Figures 3A and 3D).  The mutation-related accumulation of caspase-cleaved TAU was also observed in neurons derived from a subclone of TAU-152T/T-iPSCs (Figure S2D).  In sharp contrast, the isogenic homozygous TAU-152T/T-iPSCs generated neurons with severe degeneration and a much lower survival of neurons, as indicated by MAP2 staining (Figure 3C), and much more punctate TAU staining in neuronal processes (Figure 3F).  The mutation-related increase in TAU fragmentation was confirmed in neurons derived from a subclone of TAU-152T/T-iPSCs (Figure 4D, 152T/T-2).\n",
      "Tauopathies represent a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the accumulation of pathological TAU protein in brains.  We report a human neuronal model of tauopathy derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) carrying a TAU-A152T mutation.  Using zinc-finger nuclease-mediated gene editing, we generated two isogenic iPSC lines: one with the mutation corrected, and another with the homozygous mutation engineered.  The A152T mutation increased TAU fragmentation and phosphorylation, leading to neurodegeneration and especially axonal degeneration.  These cellular phenotypes were consistent with those observed in a patient with TAU-A152T.  Upon mutation correction, normal neuronal and axonal morphologies were restored, accompanied by decreases in TAU fragmentation and phosphorylation, whereas the severity of tauopathy was intensified in neurons with the homozygous mutation.  These isogenic TAU-iPSC lines represent a critical advancement toward the accurate modeling and mechanistic study of tauopathies with human neurons and will be invaluable for drug-screening efforts and future cell-based therapies.\n",

      "Summary for Direct Comparison of Autologous and Allogeneic Transplantation of iPSC-Derived Neural Cells in the Brain of a Nonhuman Primate: To detect the iPSC-derived cells in a brain, we introduced GFP (Figures 1G and 1H).  However, donor-cell-derived astrocytes (Figure S4B), which can express both MHC-I and MHC-II to recruit T cells in response to IFN-γ (Akesson et al., 2009; Chastain et al., 2011), could be observed in the grafts.  Consistently, the number and density of IBA1+ cells were higher in allografts than in autografts (Figures 3E, 3H, and S4C).  The in vivo studies revealed that the serum level of IFN-γ increased at 2 months, and CD45+ cells (including CD8+ cells) accumulated in the allografts 3.5-4 months after the transplant.  To induce differentiation of the cells toward midbrain DA neurons, purmorphamine/FGF8 and FGF2/FGF20 were added sequentially (Figure 1N).  In order to assess the immunogenicity of iPSC-derived neural cells in a primate brain, we generated iPSCs from four cynomolgus monkeys and directly compared the autologous and allogeneic transplantation of iPSC-derived neural cells.  Previous reports have suggested that either autologous grafts of iPSC-derived neural cells (Emborg et al., 2013; Maria et al., 2013) or allogeneic grafts of fetal ventral mesencephalic cells (Redmond et al., 2008) can survive in a primate brain without immunosuppression.  In this study, we induced DA neurons from monkey iPSCs by directed differentiation in vitro, and demonstrated that autologous transplantation of the iPSC-derived cells elicited only a minimal immune response in the nonhuman primate brain.  An immunofluorescence study did not reveal any apparent expression of MHC-I by the grafted cells (Figure S4A).  Most of the CD45+ cells were CD3+ T cells, and 60% of them were CD8+ killer T cells (Figures 3K and 3L).\n",
      "Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide the potential for autologous transplantation using cells derived from a patient's own cells.  However, the immunogenicity of iPSCs or their derivatives has been a matter of controversy, and up to now there has been no direct comparison of autologous and allogeneic transplantation in the brains of humans or nonhuman primates.  Here, using nonhuman primates, we found that the autologous transplantation of iPSC-derived neurons elicited only a minimal immune response in the brain.  In contrast, the allografts caused an acquired immune response with the activation of microglia (IBA-1+/MHC class II+) and the infiltration of leukocytes (CD45+/CD3+).  Consequently, a higher number of dopaminergic neurons survived in the autografts.  Our results suggest that the autologous transplantation of iPSC-derived neural cells is advantageous for minimizing the immune response in the brain compared with allogeneic grafts.

      "Summary for Generation of Multipotent Foregut Stem Cells from Human Pluripotent Stem Cells: SOX2+ cells and CDX2+ cells were grown into 3D organoid culture conditions (Spence et al., 2011) known to promote posterior gut differentiation.  Together, these data demonstrate that our culture system captures a homogenous population of foregut cells that can self-renew in vitro and are lineage restricted to endodermal tissue and thus could be representative of an endodermal stem cell (referred thereafter as human foregut stem cells or hFSCs).  To address this challenge, we have developed a defined culture system to derive human foregut stem cells (hFSCs) from hPSCs.  For that, heterogeneous endoderm cells generated from the hIPSC lines COXS8, COXV3, and Line4 were grown for 3 additional days in the presence of activin-A to promote foregut specification and the resulting cells were transferred into culture conditions supporting hFSCs expansion.  Importantly, production of foregut cells has been reported previously (Green et al., 2011), but our study provides a culture system allowing the isolation, expansion, and differentiation of multipotent self-renewing foregut stem cells.  These data confirm that CDX2+ cells generated in the presence of CHIR99021 have the differentiation potential to form midgut/hindgut progenitors, while activin-A-induced SOX2+ cells have lost this capacity.  However, cells expressing mesoderm (Brachyury) or neuroectoderm (N-CAM) markers were never observed and the hindgut marker CDX2 was also absent (Figure 4C) Together, these data suggest that hFSCs have the capacity to differentiate into liver, pancreas, and lung/thyroid cells and thus could be considered as multipotent stem cells.  To confirm this hypothesis, we tested the ability of hFSCs to differentiate into liver and pancreatic cells using culture systems recently developed by our group to produce these cells types directly from hPSCs (Cho et al., 2012; Rashid et al., 2010).  Importantly, these culture conditions were only supportive of foregut cells, because significant cell death was observed with neuronal-like and fibroblast-like cells.\n",
      "Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) could provide an infinite source of clinically relevant cells with potential applications in regenerative medicine.  However, hPSC lines vary in their capacity to generate specialized cells, and the development of universal protocols for the production of tissue-specific cells remains a major challenge.  Here, we have addressed this limitation for the endodermal lineage by developing a defined culture system to expand and differentiate human foregut stem cells (hFSCs) derived from hPSCs. hFSCs can self-renew while maintaining their capacity to differentiate into pancreatic and hepatic cells.  Furthermore, near-homogenous populations of hFSCs can be obtained from hPSC lines which are normally refractory to endodermal differentiation.  Therefore, hFSCs provide a unique approach to bypass variability between pluripotent lines in order to obtain a sustainable source of multipotent endoderm stem cells for basic studies and to produce a diversity of endodermal derivatives with a clinical value.  Hannan, Vallier, and colleagues have developed a defined culture system to differentiate and expand human foregut stem cells (hFSCs) from human pluripotent cells.  hFSCs can self-renew while maintaining their capacity to differentiate into pancreatic and hepatic cells.  hFSCs represent a sustainable source of multipotent endodermal cells for basic studies and can produce a diversity of endodermal derivatives with clinical value.\n",

      "Summary for Analysis of SOX2-Expressing Cell Populations Derived from Human Pluripotent Stem Cells: IF analysis for NKX2.1, the earliest marker of LPCs distinguishing it from the remainder of the AFE (Fagman et al., 2011; Que et al., 2009), revealed that >90% of GFP+ cells differentiated into NKX2.1+ lung endoderm (Figure 4D).  Similarly, gene expression analysis of cells at various stages of differentiation revealed that CD56 and CD271 expression peaked at AFE (Figure S4D).  RNA-seq of RNA from SOX2-GFP+ and SOX2-GFP- AFE cells was performed as described in the Supplemental Information section, and differential gene expression analysis was performed with TopHat and Cufflinks (Trapnell et al., 2012, 2013).  To that end, there was little expression of the pluripotency markers OCT4 and NANOG in CD56+CD271+ AFE cells when compared to undifferentiated hESCs (Figure 7E).  Genome-wide analysis of SOX2+ AFE cells revealed a global gene expression signature that distinguished hESC-derived AFE cells from other cell types.  After an initial decrease in GFP expression as cells exited the pluripotent state and differentiated toward DE, a GFP+ cell population re-emerged and expanded during the AFE stage (Figure 4A).  These data demonstrate that cell enrichment strategies for CD56 and CD271 significantly increase the percentage of cells with AFE gene expression patterns from differentiated hESC cultures.  To develop a cell surface marker \"signature\" for SOX2+ AFE cells, we mined our RNA-seq data for genes encoding transmembrane proteins with differential expression levels between GFP+ and GFP- cells (Table S2).  Collectively, this RNA-seq analysis suggests that GFP+ cells isolated from differentiating cultures are enriched for cells with an AFE gene expression profile.  Additionally, there was no difference in expression of these genes between the CD56+CD271+ and CD56-CD271- AFE cells.\n",
      "SOX2 is involved in several cell and developmental processes, including maintenance of embryonic stem cells, differentiation of neural progenitor cells, and patterning of gut endoderm.  To study its role in a human system, we generated a human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line harboring a reporter gene encoding GFP in the SOX2 locus.  This SOX2 reporter line faithfully recapitulates expression of the SOX2 gene in undifferentiated human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), neural progenitor cells (NPCs), and anterior foregut endoderm (AFE).  In undifferentiated hESCs, GFP expression corresponds to those cells with highest levels of expression of genes associated with the pluripotent state.  In NPCs, expression of GFP can be employed to isolate cells expressing markers associated with NPC multipotency.  In AFE, we used transcriptome-wide expression analysis to identify cell surface markers with elevated expression in this population, thereby facilitating isolation and purification of this hPSC-derived cell population.  SOX2 is expressed during multiple developmental stages.  Brafman, Willert, and colleagues used human embryonic stem cells carrying a SOX2 reporter to characterize its expression in undifferentiated cells and in neural and lung progenitor cells.  This approach led to the identification of a cell surface signature to isolate prospective lung progenitors.\n",

      "Summary for A Panel of CpG Methylation Sites Distinguishes Human Embryonic Stem Cells and Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells: Methylation Levels of 82 Signature Methylation Sites in hiPSCs, hESCs, and Somatic Cells, Related to Figure 1Table S2.  In a data set compiled using the Infinium 450k BeadChip system, we examined DNA methylation in 29 hiPSCs and 18 hESCs (Nazor et al., 2012).  However, on several occasions, we found heterogeneity in the methylation level at these 12 loci in hESCs (Figure S2).  Interestingly, comparisons of the hiPSC methylation signature among hESCs, hiPSCs, and somatic cells revealed that the hiPSCs' methylation pattern often resembled that of somatic cells, except at 12 CpG sites that appeared to be uniquely hypermethylated compared with both hESCs and somatic cells (Figure 1B).  In addition to global hypermethylation, some of the methylation signature sites (n = 12) were also uniquely hypermethylated in hiPSCs, but hypomethylated in both somatic cells and a portion of hESCs (Figure 1B).  We found that the methylation profiles from 82 CpG sites in 66 genes can effectively group hiPSCs separately from either hESCs or parental somatic cells (Figure 1B; Table S1 available online).  For example, we analyzed an independently derived Infinium 27k BeadChip data set that profiled DNA methylation in 20 hiPSCs and 11 hESCs (Chou et al., 2011), and showed a classification accuracy of 96%.  Strikingly, methylation quantitation of the 82 signature sites through bisulfite sequencing could also separate hiPSCs from hESCs with 95% accuracy.  Remarkably, our DNA methylation signature was also able to accurately discriminate between hiPSCs and hESCs regardless of the quantitation platform or technique used.  The increased methylation levels at promoter CpG sites in hiPSCs were confirmed by conventional bisulfite sequencing analysis (Figure S1).\n",
      "Whether human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are epigenetically identical to human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) has been debated in the stem cell field.  In this study, we analyzed DNA methylation patterns in a large number of hiPSCs (n = 114) and hESCs (n = 155), and identified a panel of 82 CpG methylation sites that can distinguish hiPSCs from hESCs with high accuracy.  We show that 12 out of the 82 CpG sites were subject to hypermethylation in part by DNMT3B.  Notably, DNMT3B contributes directly to aberrant hypermethylation and silencing of the signature gene, TCERG1L.  Overall, we conclude that DNMT3B is involved in a wave of de novo methylation during reprogramming, a portion of which contributes to the unique hiPSC methylation signature.  These 82 CpG methylation sites may be useful as biomarkers to distinguish between hiPSCs and hESCs.  Huang et al. identify a panel of 82 CpG methylation sites that can robustly distinguish hiPSCs from hESCs with high accuracy.  Part of the signature consists of aberrantly hypermethylated CpG sites, which are partially abrogated in the absence of DNMT3B.  In addition, DNMT3B-mutant hiPSCs do not exhibit other aberrant hypermethylation signatures as previously reported.\n",

      "Summary for Human RPE Stem Cells Grown into Polarized RPE Monolayers on a Polyester Matrix Are Maintained after Grafting into Rabbit Subretinal Space: However, we note that, in the study by Bhatt et al. (1994) in which fetal hRPE cell monolayers survived 6 weeks, they removed the host RPE prior to transplantation, indicating that graft survival was not due to the host RPE layer creating an immune- privileged SRS.  The method for adult RPE culture followed our prior publication (Blenkinsop et al., 2013).  We have optimized culture conditions that robustly activate a subpopulation of adult human RPE stem cells (RPESC), expand, and then differentiate them into highly pure RPE monolayers that exhibit physiological features of native RPE (Blenkinsop et al., 2013; Salero et al., 2012).  Here, we show that, similar to fetal hRPE (Liao et al., 2010), adult hRPE cultures can exhibit characteristics similar to native adult human RPE.  Moreover, fetal and adult hRPE on PET carriers stained positively for the human-specific marker SC121, confirming survival of human RPE for 1 month as a monolayer (Figure 3).  Here, we demonstrate that polarized human fetal and adult RPE monolayers cultured on a polyester matrix can survive grafting into the rabbit SRS, thus resolving many of the current roadblocks concerning clinical RPE monolayer transplantation.  This is encouraging, given that prior studies using RPE cell suspensions showed they failed to survive or function on aged submacular Bruch's membrane (Sugino et al., 2011) and are more likely to be rejected than are RPE monolayers (Diniz et al., 2013).  With the development of RPE differentiation protocols from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Hirami et al., 2009; Klimanskaya et al., 2004), RPE transplantation has experienced a powerful renaissance, as scientists and clinicians envision an unlimited supply of RPE for transplantation.  The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a cellular monolayer between the retina and the underlying choroidal vasculature.  Subretinal implantation of 45 such constructs was evaluated, which included 40 fetal and five adult human RPE monolayer implants (Table 1).  The adult RPESC-derived RPE cultures were shipped live from the US to the German surgical team.  Fetal RPE cultured in this manner shows morphology and gene/protein expression similar to native RPE, thereby serving as a reference for adult-stem-cell-derived RPE (Liao et al., 2010).  The adverse effect of DXP that we observed on xenograft survival was unexpected but perhaps mediated through the RPE glucocorticoid receptor, which promotes RPE proliferation (He et al., 1994).  Very little is known regarding optimal conditions for RPE implant shipment, and our studies have established conditions for successful cultured RPE monolayer transport.\n",
      "Transplantation of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is being developed as a cell-replacement therapy for age-related macular degeneration.  Human embryonic stem cell (hESC) and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived RPE are currently translating toward clinic.  We introduce the adult human RPE stem cell (hRPESC) as an alternative RPE source.  Polarized monolayers of adult hRPESC-derived RPE grown on polyester (PET) membranes had near-native characteristics.  Trephined pieces of RPE monolayers on PET were transplanted subretinally in the rabbit, a large-eyed animal model.  After 4 days, retinal edema was observed above the implant, detected by spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and fundoscopy.  At 1 week, retinal atrophy overlying the fetal or adult transplant was observed, remaining stable thereafter.  Histology obtained 4 weeks after implantation confirmed a continuous polarized human RPE monolayer on PET.  Taken together, the xeno-RPE survived with retained characteristics in the subretinal space.  These experiments support that adult hRPESC-derived RPE are a potential source for transplantation therapies.  Stanzel et al. have transplanted polarized monolayers of human retinal pigment epithelium (hRPE) grown on polyester membranes derived from adult hRPE stem cells or fetal tissue under the rabbit retina.  The xeno-RPE survived 4 weeks with retained cell polarity characteristics in the subretinal space.  These experiments support that adult hRPESC-derived RPE are a potential source for transplantation therapies.\n",

result of further uplift and restriction of the North Sea Basin, bringing the coastline and transported terrestrial material into closer proximity to the centrally-located 22/10a-4, although there is no documented sea level fall in the North Sea preceding the CIE (Knox, 1996; Powell et al., 1996).', 'Despite the limitations of this method, the large variation in the %low salinity dinoflagellate cysts (ranging from 0% to 80%) clearly indicates that significant environmental changes in surface water conditions occurred during the CIE onset in the central North Sea, and is supported by coeval changes in the sedimentary carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio (Fig. 10) which reflects changes in the proportion of terrestrial/marine organic material deposited in the North Sea Basin due to terrestrial runoff and productivity (see Section 4.4).', 'As there is no direct evidence for regional uplift causing further restriction of the North Sea Basin associated with the CIE onset, increased regional precipitation may have been the major cause of increased C/N ratios (elevated fluvial runoff) and dinoflagellate cyst changes (lower surface water salinity) at and following the CIE onset in 22/10a-4 (Fig. 9).', 'Since dinoflagellate cysts indicate increased halocline stratification of the North Sea at the CIE (Fig. 9d), and C/N ratios indicate a greater proportion of terrestrial carbon (Fig. 9c),

acid to the Southern Ocean surface is most likely to have increased across the period of diatom δ30Si rise.', 'Without Southern Ocean upwelling, or exchange between the Pacific and Atlantic basins, overturning circulation would have been sluggish (Cramer et al., 2009) trapping silicic acid and other nutrients in the deep ocean, limiting surface primary productivity and hence organic carbon burial via the biological pump.', 'Our new records of diatom and sponge δ30Si are shown in Fig. 6c and b (respectively) alongside benthic δ18O stacks for the main ocean basins (Fig. 6a) in which the

concentration and ocean circulation (Fig. 2b) which can be used as a constraint on the concentration of silicic acid supplied to the surface ocean, facilitating resolution of the effects upon diatom δ30Si of diatom uptake and silicic acid supply.', 'Although diatom production is not always linked to carbon export in the modern ocean, a strong coupling between production and export is observed in regions where nutrient supply is continuous, strong seasonal blooms occur and a diatom flora particularly efficient at carbon export exists, such as at Southern Ocean sites such near the Antarctic Polar Front (Buesseler et al., 2001).', 'These upwelled waters are advected northwards by Ekman transport and thus provide nutrients that fuel diatom (as well as other phytoplankton) production, creating marked bands of opal and carbon export (Fig. 1; Speer et al., 2000; Ito et al., 2005).', 'Diatoms originated in the Jurassic, and open ocean diatom diversity and abundance increased through the late Cretaceous and Palaeogene, pumping silicic acid to depth and driving a concomitant decrease in shelf chert abundance (Maliva et al., 1989).', 'Such conditions of upwelling and high nutrient availability would have favoured diatom proliferation and opal export; high diatom nutrient uptake and growth rates, along with their large storage vacuole, provide a competitive advantage over other phytoplankton when nutrient input to the surface is high and episodic (Falkowski et al.,1998; Rabosky and Sorhannus, 2009; Tozzi et al., 2004).', 'Diatom production is characterised by high, rapid particle flux out of near surface waters, a process which enhances labile carbon concentration and organic carbon remineralisation in the deep ocean (Henson et al., 2012).', 'Together, the diatom and

has shown the 2-20μm fraction is generally most representative of diatom δ30Si (Egan et al., 2012).', 'Diatom carbon fixation and silicification, which may be decoupled by changes in iron fertilisation or the relative silicifcation of the ambient species (Ragueneau et al., 2000), are suggested to have remained coupled through this time period based on the broad coincidence between increased diatom production (δ30Si, Southern Ocean opal burial), increased organic carbon burial, and positively trending δ13C (Anderson and Delaney, 2005; Diester-Haass, 1995; Salamy and Zachos,

with the lidar overestimating the wind speed by between 0 and 0.5ms-1.', 'Compared to other lidar wind profiling methods (e.g. VAD), which take many more samples, DBS is relatively fast.', 'A linear fit has been applied to the data using a weighted total least squares, with the weighting determined by the sampling error of each hourly mean wind speed from both the sonic anemometer and the lidar (Section 2.2.4).', 'Data collected when the sonic anemometer records a wind direction between 315° and 45° are removed as wind speed data from the sonic anemometer in these conditions is considered to be unreliable.', 'In order to evaluate the performance of the DBS scanning technique, data from the sonic anemometer at the BT Tower was compared with data from the lidar gate corresponding to the height of the BT Tower instruments.', 'An estimate of the uncertainty of the lidar wind speeds was calculated and the suitability of the DBS method for urban wind profiling was assessed.', 'Fig. 8 shows the mean difference between wind speeds measured by the lidar and sonic anemometer against anemometer wind speed.', 'The lidar has several built-in scanning modes, including a DBS wind profiling setting which is used here.', 'At wind speeds greater than 20ms-1 the lidar appears to be overestimating the wind speed.', 'Another potential source of error in the lidar wind speed measurements is a tilting of the instrument so that the beam is slightly offset from its intended position.', 'In order to compare data from an anemometer with the lidar, the height above ground of the anemometer must exceed the minimum range of the lidar.'], ['Fig. 10 shows contour plots of the mean concentration at two different heights z=0.23H and z=0.98H for 0° and 45° flow over the aligned array.', 'As in the 0° flow, the fluctuation intensity I is larger than within the array; it generally decreases with distance from the source, except when the mean concentration C is very small.', 'Figs. 13-16 show concentration time series and computed statistics at different locations within and just above the aligned array for 0° and 45° flow.', 'Fig. 16 shows corresponding plots for blocks immediately above the array for the 45° flow.', 'These near-field dispersion characteristics derive from the underlying flow structure around the buildings, which exerts a strong influence in the near field where there is a higher concentration of material.', 'This is consistent with the picture that material released at the initial source location moves horizontally into the wake region of adjacent buildings where it is then pushed up by the updraft flow visualised in Section 3.1.3 and then spread by the faster flow above the array.', 'Having surveyed the structure of the flow field, we now move on to consider its effect on the resulting concentration patterns and dispersion characteristics.', 'Additionally, we present results for new simulations done for flow at an angle of 45° over a smaller staggered array of domain size 8H x 8H×8H x 8H×8H - see Fig. 1c.', 'Fig. 4e and f shows the corresponding pattern of streamlines for flow at 45° over the staggered array.', 'As discussed earlier, the concentration pattern results from the trapping of material into the wake of the building immediately upstream of the source, and the escape of material into the channels on either side, which is then swept downstream in the fast flow in the channel.', 'Corresponding time series and concentration statistics are shown for the blocks just above the array in Fig. 14.', 'Secondly, the recirculations trap material and release them on a slower timescale (Vincent, 1978) higher up and into the flow above the array.', 'Dispersion within a building array is heavily influenced by the flow structure and how it varies in space and time.', 'This is illustrated here for the 45° aligned array case by looking at lateral profiles of concentration just above the array (at z=1.02H) at different distances from the original source (Fig. 12).'], ['It demonstrates which actions can be executed in what level to achieve SLA adherence and efficient resource allocation for Cloud infrastructures.', 'For the rule-based approach we first introduce several resource policy modes to reflect the overall utilization of the system in the VM configuration rules.', 'Design, Implementation and Evaluation of two KM techniques for one escalation level, i.e., VM resource configuration: CBR, and the rule-based approach.', 'The goal of the simulation engine is to evaluate the quality of a KM system with respect to the number of SLA violations, the utilization of the resources and the number of required reallocation actions.', 'Nevertheless, when we relate SLA violations and resource utilization in terms of RAE, all CBR methods are generally better than the default method, especially for α∈{0.3,0.5} after five iterations.', 'We demonstrate by simulation that the rule-based approach can guarantee the resource requirements in terms of CPU, memory and storage for the execution of the workflow in a resource-efficient way.', 'The main challenge in this work is to evaluate KM techniques for autonomic SLA enactment in Cloud computing infrastructures that fulfill the three following conflicting goals: (i) achieving low SLA violation rates; (ii) achieving high resource utilization such that the level of allocated but unused resources is as low as possible; and (iii) achieving (i) and (ii) by as few time- and energy-consuming reallocation actions as possible.', 'However, fewer SLA violations result in lower resource utilization (cf.', 'A more general approach also taking into account the cost of actions represents the definition of a generic cost function that maps SLA violations, resource wastage and the costs of executed actions into a monetary unit, which we want to call Cloud EUR.', 'This is possible, because Scenario 2.6 achieves a very good utilization and SLA violation rate with a very low number of reallocation actions.', 'The subsequent evaluations will be based on the following performance indicators: violations, utilization, actions, resource allocation efficiency (RAE), costs, and time efficiency.', 'Summarizing, the rule-based approach highly outperforms CBR with respect to violations (up to 82 times better results), actions, cost, and time performance.', 'Fig. 3 shows the regions and measurements (expressed as utilization of a certain resource) at time steps t1,t2,…,t6.', 'Our KM system allows us to choose any arbitrary number of resource parameters that can be adjusted on a VM.', 'As depicted in Fig. 11(a)-(c) one sees violations, utilization, as well as the number of reconfiguration actions, respectively, for every parameter (together with an average value) in the different scenarios.'], ['Effect of fast local memory size: in some algorithms, including the dynamic programming via matrix multiplication, the size of the fast memory affects the performance of the algorithm in the TMM model.', 'Section 5 provides the lessons learned from this model; in particular, we see that algorithms that have the same PRAM performance have different performance in the TMM model since they are better at hiding memory latency with fewer threads.', 'Therefore, if there are enough threads, we should, in principle, be able to use PRAM algorithms on such machines, since we can ignore the effect of memory transfers which is exactly what PRAM model does.', 'The PRAM model also ignores the vagaries of the memory hierarchy and assumes that each memory access by the algorithm takes unit time.', 'In particular, we compare these algorithms and find specific relationships between hardware parameters (latency, fast memory size, limits on number of threads) under which some algorithms are better than others even if they have the same PRAM cost.', 'Among our shortest paths algorithms, only the dynamic programming algorithm makes use of the local memory and the running time depends on this fast memory size.', 'In this experiment we verify the effect of this fast memory size on algorithm performance.', 'In addition, for certain problem sizes which fit in local memory, algorithms which are faster on PRAM may be slower under the TMM model.', 'In particular, it requires the work and depth (like PRAM algorithms), but also requires the analysis of the number of memory accesses.', 'Since no highly-threaded, many-core machine allows an infinite number of threads, it is important to understand both (1) how many threads does a particular algorithm need to achieve PRAM performance, and (2) how does an algorithm perform when it has fewer threads than required to get PRAM performance?', 'If the latency of transfers from slow memory to fast memory is small, or if the number of threads per processor is infinite, then this model generally provides the same analysis results as the PRAM analysis.', 'In this work, we propose the Threaded Many-core Memory (TMM) model that captures the performance characteristics of these highly-threaded, many-core machines.', 'In the dynamic programming algorithm, we consider the array of size n2 and being able to fit a row into local memory does not reduce the number of memory transfers.', 'This model explicitly models the large number of threads per processor and the memory latency to slow memory.', 'The TMM model is a high-level abstract model, meant to be applicable to many instantiations of hardware platforms that feature a large number of threads with fast context switching and a hierarchical memory subsystem of at least two levels with a large memory latency gap in between.', 'However, from Section 5.2, for a small number of threads/core working on a dense graph, the TMM model predicts that dynamic programming may be better.', \"In the PRAM model, the algorithm's complexity is analyzed in terms of its work-the time taken by the algorithm on 1 processor, and span (also called depth and critical-path length)-the time taken by the algorithm on an infinite number of processors.\"], ['A network node represents a complete SpiNNaker chip, with all its cores and its router.', 'As discussed in Section 5, the SpiNNaker system is aware of network failures and can modify its routing tables to avoid conflictive areas.', 'The basic unit of the system is the SpiNNaker chip (Fig. 4), custom GALS SoC with a network router and 18 cores sharing some resources such as a SRAM, a boot ROM, a System Controller, an Ethernet interface and an 128Mbyte off-chip (but in-package, see Fig. 2) SDRAM.', 'With a very pessimistic scenario model of a 5-year mean time to failure (MTTF) with sigma of 2 years, the expected number of link failures in a complete SpiNNaker system (65,536 nodes) for any given day (Fday) would lie between 160 and 360.', 'In extreme failure cases the System Controller can be accessed from a neighbouring SpiNNaker chip using a local debug facility.', 'A SpiNNaker system communicates with a host computer via Ethernet (Fig. 1) using TCP/IP.', 'Each SpiNNaker chip performs diagnostics and initialization using minimal system software stored in the Boot ROM.', 'A system of this scale may be expected to suffer component failures and many features of its design are included to provide a certain degree of fault tolerance.', 'This architecture, while biologically inspired, uses a fixed synapse and neuron model and, therefore, is not a system as general as SpiNNaker.', 'For fault tolerance at boot-up or at run-time a self-test mechanism is kept in each chip to perform system diagnostics.'], ['In the Costa Rican experiment reduction in average SOC stocks in 10-40cm depth soil occurred in all shade and management treatments.', 'Over the whole 0-40cm soil depth there was a decrease in SOC stock during the experiment for three and an increase in two of the shade treatments.', 'Therefore, over the whole 0-40cm soil depth there was a similar mean decrease in SOC stock between the two pruned and two un-pruned shade types (9.9 and 9.7MgCha-1 respectively); thus the average SOC stock increased across all treatments by 8.5% in the top 10cm of soil and decreased by 21.8% in the 10-40cm depth.', 'The results of the present study showed that coffee production systems under organic management increased SOC stocks in the top 10cm of soil more than did conventional production systems in Costa Rica (with a highly significant ANOVA test result), but not in Nicaragua.', 'In Nicaragua no significant differences in changes of SOC stock between the organic and conventional treatments were detected for any soil depth.', 'In the Nicaraguan experiment the previous land use had been coffee with shade trees and no drainage was carried out, and its reduction in average SOC stock in deeper soil had been much less (only 2.85MgCha-1 at 20-40cm soil depth).', 'The contrasts within the ANOVA for 0-10cm soil depth SOC stock changes for Costa Rica further support the findings of the mixed effect models, showing a significantly greater increase in SOC stock in the organic than the conventional management treatments (p=0.0001) (Fig. 3).', 'In both the Nicaraguan and Costa Rican experiments during the first nine years of coffee and tree establishment, SOC stocks in 20-40cm depth soil generally decreased (and this also occurred in 10-20cm depth soil in Costa Rica, giving an average loss over 10-40cm of 12.1MgCha-1).', 'Across the treatments there were differences in trend of SOC stocks amongst the soil depths in both countries.', 'In Nicaragua, similar to the results in Costa Rica, in the top 10cm of soil there was an increase in mean SOC stock for every shade treatments

Rica, whereas in Nicaragua (where the long-term land use before the experiment had been the same as afterwards, shaded coffee) there was a much smaller decrease in average 0-40cm depth SOC stock of 0.2MgCha-1 (0.14%).', 'Especially in the organic systems, which have additional organic matter inputs in the form of manures and coffee pulp, the climate change mitigation potential of the gains in SOC stock in the 0-10cm depth soil equate to an average of 1.45MgCO2eha-1year-1 in Costa Rica and 0.88MgCO2eha-1year-1 in Nicaragua, both of which lie well within the range of estimated non-CO2 GHG emissions from soil resulting from the inputs of organic matter.', 'This is further supported by the significant differences in SOC stock changes between the treatments with pruned and un-pruned trees in Costa Rica, though all treatments showed a huge contrast in trends of SOC stock with soil depth between an increase at 0-10cm and a decrease at 20-40cm.', 'In addition, the penetration of roots into the deeper soil, and thereby the deposition of C at that depth (which showed the greatest decrease in SOC stocks) would have been delayed during the establishment of the new trees and coffee bushes.', 'The specific objectives were to investigate (a) how the addition and management of trees in agricultural systems change total SOC stocks through the soil profile and (b) how agronomic management affects SOC stocks in comparison with the effects of the trees.', 'In the present study, the plots with initially higher SOC stocks tended to have greater SOC losses (or smaller gains) during the observed period of coffee system establishment, notwithstanding the major difference between them in shade tree and coffee management treatments (Figs.', 'Specifically, in Costa Rica the change in land-use from long-term arable sugar cane agriculture to an agroforestry system with perennial coffee and shade trees does not lead to an increase in SOC stocks over the first nine years, which is contrary to the widely held expectation (Powlson et al., 2011b).'], ['In conclusion, we have successfully demonstrated a protocol passaging hiPSC in an automated system, the CompacT SelecT,

Loughborough University where it was further cultured and passaged in T25 flasks using the manual protocol established at LRM (Brons et al., 2007).', 'The changes made in the four versions of the automated protocol were based on: (a) the time for the colonies to settle down by gravity after washing, (b) the distance of the pipette from the bottom of the flask when removing diluted enzyme solution without aspirating the cells clumps, (c) the pipetting speed and number of mixing steps required to achieve an homogeneous cell suspension of the desirable cell clump size without the presence of an undue number of single cells, and (d) the split ratio (Table 2).', 'It proved difficult to use the CEDEX cell counter to count clumps of cells in order to passage cells based on cell count as the CEDEX could not count the clumps accurately (data not shown).', 'Thus this platform can be used to expand and differentiate batches of cells to a tighter specification than manual cell culture (Liu et al., 2010).', 'For many manual cell culture protocols, there is a centrifugation step to concentrate the cell suspension and allow for cells to be washed.', 'At Loughborough

topography/roughness can be reliably measured without metallization.', 'In conclusion, we have been able to show that a relatively thin HSQ film on metallic substrates such as molds for injection molding is able to greatly to decrease surface roughness.', 'For the 3-D optical profiler measurements on surfaces coated with the cured HSQ films it was necessary to sputter a thin layer of a reflective film in order to characterize roughness of HSQ coated surfaces.', 'Samples that have been spray-coated with HSQ and cured show considerably reduced roughness as shown in Fig. 1.', 'This finally allows surface topography measurement on HSQ coated substrates using a 3-D optical profilometer, as shown in Fig. 4.', 'A soft HSQ film reflows to achieve the minimal surface area.', 'To increase reflectance of the HSQ film and to avoid light transmission and reflection from the metal substrate, we sputter coated cured HSQ samples with a thin film of gold/palladium (80/20) alloy.', 'The bottom row shows profiles of same surfaces coated with a cured HSQ film.', 'We can also directly see a low roughness top surface, with islands and voids of metal from a deposition of a reflective film.', 'Hence, HSQ only reflects approximately 2.4-2.7% of incident light, assuming perpendicular incidence and no roughness.', 'Half of sample area was masked with cleanroom blue tape, and therefore not coated with HSQ.', 'Therefore we sputtered thin reflective films not only on HSQ coated samples but also on silicon wafer samples, to verify the topography change due to the sputtering of a reflective film.', 'We see substantial decrease of roughness on the HSQ coated samples; approximately 10 times for a sample with initially higher roughness and 3 times for a sample with initially lower roughness.', 'This, together with an uneven, rough and highly reflective metallic substrate surface under the HSQ prevents reliable optical characterization without metallization.', 'With a

delamination even after fracturing for cross-sectional SEM.', 'This device was obtained using 125nm thick AALD ZnO (deposited in only 4.5 min) and tested one week after manufacture.', 'AALD ZnO films are therefore highly suited as multifunctional components for inverted BHJ devices.', 'Also, since the AALD ZnO films were deposited at 150°C, it is not expected that post-annealing at temperatures lower than 150°C would significantly improve the device performance, especially considering the cost of the increased processing time and increased energy requirement.', 'By comparing Fig. 3c with 3d

shown that the effect of irradiance on device performance is largely due to device design, while the temperature and spectral response are dominated by the band gap and material quality of the

strategy and should therefore not be an issue for the chosen control strategy.', 'The simulated performance is only slightly lower than for a reference control strategy with known wind speed.', 'To tune this strategy for the highest power coefficient at a given wind speed, both λmax and CPmax have to be known at this speed.', 'To further illustrate the control strategies at low rotational velocities, the power and torque are plotted against the rotational velocity in Fig. 5 and are compared to the aerodynamic torque for wind speeds of 4.5 m/s and 6 m/s.', 'Control strategies A-C are implemented by controlling the load current so that the average of the extracted power Pe from the turbine is as close as possible to the power Pe* prescribed by the applied control strategy.', 'If this strategy operates at the stable equilibrium and there is an increase in wind speed, the aerodynamic power will increase, hence P>Pe and the turbine will accelerate until a new equilibrium is reached (compare with Fig. 5).', 'The reference strategy uses both the asymptotic wind speed and the rotational velocity as control signals.'], ['At the time when the mutual topology stops extracting

independent, this is disadvantageous as it does not allow each turbine to fully adapt to the changes in wind speed.', '[10], a control strategy where the extracted power is proportional to the cube of

interaction of the turbines, making it possible to study the control system behaviour when one turbine is in the wake of another.', 'The significant change in behaviour for the mutual topology at time 1800 s occurs when the turbine that experiences the lowest wind speed (turbine 4) stops delivering power and all turbine power is used to overcome the generator core loss.', 'It was seen in Section 6.1 that for large variations in wind speed between the turbines, the separate topology should perform better, which is seen here.', 'In the case with significant differences in wind speed between different turbines, it is investigated if the total power for the mutual topology can be increased through modification of the extracted power according to(14)Pe,k=k∑i=1NPe(ωi).', \"If the wind speed

of blades, c is the chord and R is the radius.', 'With the same convergence criterion as for the free flow and all turbines simulated at optimal tip speed ratio, the convergence for a turbine with σ = 0.12 is given in Fig. 4.', 'Compared to the idealized theoretical maximum for channels, the simulations show that the increase in performance due to the channel for a turbine optimized for free flow is smaller than the simple analytical expectation, and this difference increases with increased blockage ratio.', 'This also work the other way around: If a turbine is optimized while in a channel, it will probably not be optimal for the free flow case, which should be taken into account for all volume discretization methods.', 'Note that the required number of revolutions for convergence varies substantially, depending on many parameters, such as the channel length, how much the turbine decreases the flow velocity etc.', 'For the design of the turbine, the simulations with higher solidities show that when designing a turbine for a channel, the optimal design will be different compared to the free flow case.', 'The simulations also indicate that the turbine should be designed differently

traces, CafRep achieves lowest success ratio in the SF Cab traces [45] (48-44%) due to three reasons: first due to the SF Cab [45] topology described in Section 5.1, the social utility in CafRep cannot identify nodes that are significantly more central; second as the isolation periods are very high, the nodes cannot offload their content for a very long time; and third as the connectivity periods are very short, the publishing nodes that generate data at a constant rate cause increased dropped packets.', 'We proposed CafRep that uses a combined local social, buffer and delay metrics for congestion aware message forwarding and replication that maximises message delivery ratio and availability of nodes while minimising latency and packet loss rates at times of increasing congestion levels.', 'When congestion happens, the combined utility allows CafRep to de-cluster individual nodes and parts of the network by leveraging social metric with resource constraints.', 'As these nodes become overloaded, forwarding to a lower ranked node may lead to more even spread of the network load in the network and lower congestion rates, but also to increased number of intermediaries for the forwarded messages.', 'As discussed in Section 3, we believe that this higher cost for CafRep in SF Cab trace [45] comes from high weighting of ego network resources and social utility in a trace that does not have node connectivity with good pattern of regularity.', 'Sassy [44] trace is more challenging than Infocom 2006 because it does not include any infrastructure-like nodes (such as semi-static and static nodes such as those deployed during Infocom2006 [33]) that participate in forwarding, has significantly shorter connectivity durations and sparser network.', 'In this way, CafRep enables replication at different rates at different parts of the network that are dissimilar from each other and thus have different social and resource characteristics and patterns.', 'For SF

heuristics that exploits contact relationships among nodes to allow optimal directionality and delivery probability of a node; node resource driven heuristics that aim to adopt to the nodes' buffer
