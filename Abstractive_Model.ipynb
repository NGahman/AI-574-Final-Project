We examined whether standard clinical risk profiles developed for vascular diseases also predict depressive symptoms in older adults. Data were drawn from the Whitehall II study with baseline examination in 1991 and follow-up screenings in 1997, 2003, and 2008. Diagnosed vascular disease was associated with an increased risk for depressive symptoms.\n",

The PETM was a period of geologically-rapid global warming that punctuated a warming Eocene climate 55.8Ma ago. It was associated with a substantial injection of δ13C-depleted carbon into the ocean-atmosphere system. This may have been linked to the dissociation of marine hydrates containing biogenic methane. Increased precipitation and runoff likely occurred along with carbon release.\n",
      "Summary for 'Opening the gateways for diatoms primes Earth for Antarctic glaciation': Biogenic silicon cycling is inextricably linked to both long and short term carbon cycling through the diatoms. Diatom abundance could have contributed to pCO2 drawdown and global cooling by increasing the proportion of organic carbon buried in marine sediment. Upwelling intensification related to the spin-up of a circum-Antarctic current may have driven late Eocene diatom proliferation.\n",

In October 2011, Gemini and HST observations revealed another unusually bright cloud feature near 23°N. This second bright spot was found to be a companion of a new dark spot on Uranus, only the second ever observed. Both spots exhibited variable drift rates during the nearly 5months of tracking, and both varied in brightness.\n",

Tri-catechol/Fe3+ complexation leads to compaction of the surface protein film. Exposure to a diluted FeCl3 solution results in enhanced complexation within the Adsorbed protein film, leading to water removal and film compaction.\n",

      "Summary for 'Amos-type bounds for modified Bessel function ratios': Amos-type bounds for modified Bessel function ratios are of great importance in a variety of application areas. In this paper, we investigate the structure of lower and upper bounds for Rν. We also provide a new family of explicitly computable upper bounds. These bounds are very attractive because they allow both for explicit inversion and integration.\n",
      "Summary for 'A note on weakly hyperbolic equations with analytic principal part': In this note we show how to include low order terms in the well-posedness results for weakly hyperbolic equations with analytic time-dependent coefficients.

Prevalence of tinnitus was significantly higher for males, and increased with age, doubling between the youngest and oldest age groups. Neuroticism has been associated with adverse outcomes in various health conditions, including increased likelihood of morbidity in those with testicular cancer.\n",

Understanding the effects of microbial diversity on functional parameters is important for advancing sustainable soil management techniques.\n",
      "Summary for 'Soil structural responses to alterations in soil microbiota induced by the dilution method and mycorrhizal fungal inoculation': Surface waves on Saturn's magnetopause promote energy transport into the magnetosphere. Growth of the Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) instability produces greater wave activity on the dawn side of the surface than on the dusk side. There is no evidence for the predicted difference across the surface. The lack of the hypothesized dawn-dusk asymmetry in wave activity demonstrates that we need to revise our understanding of the growth of K-H instability.\n",
      "Summary for 'Surface waves on Saturn's magnetopause': The transterminator ion flow in the Venusian ionosphere is observed at solar minimum for the first time. Such a flow, which transports ions from the day to the nightside, has been observed previously around solar maximum. At solar minimum this transport process is severely inhibited by the lower altitude of the ionopause.\n",
      "Summary for 'The transterminator ion flow at Venus at solar minimum': Energy distribution asymmetry of electron precipitation signatures at Mars. Most common type of energy distribution is of isotropic electrons and upward heavy-ions. Heavy-ion flow at Mars mostly unaffected by electron precipitation due to finite gyro-radius. Acceleration of heavy-ion is rarely observed during electron precipitation.\n",
      "Summary for 'Energy distribution asymmetry of electron precipitation signatures at Mars': Response of the Jovian thermosphere to a transient 'pulse' in solar wind pressure. A solar wind shock causes the reversal of currents and angular momentum transfer. These rapid magnetospheric reconfigurations result in local thermospheric temperature increases >25K. We discuss the implications of this behaviour for global energy transport.\n",
      "Summary for 'Response of the Jovian thermosphere to a transient 'pulse' in solar wind pressure': Epoxy polymers have inherently low toughness and impact resistance due to their crosslinked structure. This structure causes the polymers to suffer from relatively poor resistance to crack initiation and growth. To improve the toughness of epoxy polymer, it has been established that the incorporation of a second micro-phase of a dispersed rubber, e.g. thermoplastic particles, can increase toughness.\n",
      "Summary for 'The mechanical properties and toughening mechanisms of an epoxy polymer modified with polysiloxane-based core-shell particles': Silica nanoparticles possessing three different diameters (23, 74 and 170 nm) were used to modify a piperidine-cured epoxy polymer.

Eighty-two DNA methylation sites distinguish hiPSCs and hESCs with high accuracy. Twelve aberrantly hypermethylated signature CG sites are due in part to DNMT3B.\n",
      "Summary for 'A Panel of CpG Methylation Sites Distinguishes Human Embryonic Stem Cells and Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells': Transplantation of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is being developed as a cell-replacement therapy for age-related macular degeneration. Human embryonic stem cell and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived RPE are currently translating toward clinic. We introduce the adult human RPE stem cell as an alternative RPE source. Polarized monolayers of adult hRPESC- derived RPE grown on PET had near-native characteristics.\n"
