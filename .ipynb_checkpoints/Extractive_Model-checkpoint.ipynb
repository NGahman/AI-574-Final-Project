Keller and Olson [9].)\\nA polynomial f∈Z[x], f=∑kak(x)k, induces the zero-function mod pn if and only if ak≡0 mod pn-α(k) for all k (or, equivalently, for all k<β(n)).\\nProof\\nInduction on k using the facts that (m)k=0 for m<k, that vp((n)k)⩾αp(k) for all n∈Z, and that vp((k)k)=vp(k!)=αp(k). □\\nCorollary 2.3\\n(Cf. Keller and Olson [9].)\\nEvery polynomial function on Zpn is represented by a unique f∈Z[x] of the form f=∑k=0β(n)-1ak(x)k, with 0⩽ak<pn-α(k) for all k.\\nComparing the canonical forms of polynomial functions mod pn with those mod pn-1 we see that every polynomial function mod pn-1 gives rise to pβ(n) different polynomial functions mod pn:\\nCorollary 2.4\\n(See cf. Keller and Olson [9].) \\nLet (Fn,∘) be the monoid of polynomial functions on Zpn with respect to composition and πn:Fn+1→Fn the canonical projection.\\n(1) For all n⩾1 and for each f∈Fn we have |πn-1(f)|=pβ(n+1).\\n(2) For all n⩾1, the number of polynomial functions on Zpn is|Fn|=p∑k=1nβ(k).\\nNotation\\nWe write [f]pn for the function defined by f∈Z[x] on Zpn.\\nLemma 2.5\\nEvery polynomial f∈Z[x] is uniquely representable asf(x)=f0(x)+f1(x)(xp-x)+f2(x)(xp-x)2+⋯+fm(x)(xp-x)m+⋯ with fm∈Z[x], degfm<p, for all m⩾0.\\nNow let f,g∈Z[x].\\n(1) If n⩽p, then [f]pn=[g]pn is equivalent to: fk=gk mod pn-kZ[x] for 0⩽k<n.\\n(2) [f]p2=[g]p2 is equivalent to: f0=g0 mod p2Z[x] and f1=g1 mod pZ[x].\\n(3) [f]p=[g]p and [f′]p=[g′]p is equivalent to: f0=g0 mod pZ[x] and f1=g1 mod pZ[x].\\nProof\\nThe canonical representation is obtained by repeated division with remainder by (xp-x), and uniqueness follows from uniqueness of quotient and remainder of polynomial division.\\nNote that [f]p=[f0]p and [f′]p=[f0′-f1]p.\\nThis gives (3).\\nDenote by f∼g the equivalence relation fk=gk mod pn-kZ[x] for 0⩽k<n.\\nThen f∼g implies [f]pn=[g]pn.\\nThere are pp+2p+3p+⋯+np equivalence classes of ∼ and pβ(1)+β(2)+β(3)+⋯+β(n) different [f]pn.\\nFor k⩽p, β(k)=kp.\\nTherefore the equivalence relations f∼g and [f]pn=[g]pn coincide.\\nThis gives (1), and (2) is just the special case n=2. □\\nWe can rephrase this in terms of ideals of Z[x].\\nCorollary 2.6\\nFor every n∈N, consider the two ideals of Z[x]In={f∈Z[x]|f(Z)⊆pnZ} and Jn=({pn-k(xp-x)k|0⩽k⩽n}).\\nThen [Z[x]:In]=pβ(1)+β(2)+β(3)+⋯+β(n) and [Z[x]:Jn]=pp+2p+3p+⋯+np.\\nTherefore, Jn=In for n⩽p, whereas for n>p, Jn is properly contained in In.\\nProof\\nJn⊆In. \\nThe index of Jn in Z[x] is pp+2p+3p+⋯+np, because f∈Jn if and only if fk=0 mod pn-kZ[x] for 0⩽k<n in the canonical representation of Lemma 2.5.\\nThe index of In in Z[x] is pβ(1)+β(2)+β(3)+⋯+β(n) by Corollary 2.4(2) and [Z[x]:In]<[Z[x]:Jn] if and only if n>p by Fact 2.1(2). □\\nFact 2.7\\n(Cf. McDonald [12].) \\nLet n⩾2.\\nThe function on Zpn induced by a polynomial f∈Z[x] is a permutation if and only if (1) f induces a permutation of Zp, and (2) the derivative f′ has no zero mod p.\\nLemma 2.8\\nLet [f]pn and [f]p be the functions defined by f∈Z[x] on Zpn and Zp, respectively, and [f′]p the function defined by the formal derivative of f on Zp. \\nThen (1) [f]p2 determines not just [f]p, but also [f′]p.\\n(2) Let n⩾2.\\nThen [f]pn is a permutation if and only if [f]p2 is a permutation.\\n(3) For every pair of functions (α,β), α:Zp→Zp, β:Zp→Zp, there are exactly pp polynomial functions [f]p2 on Zp2 with [f]p=α and [f′]p=β.\\n(4) For every pair of functions (α,β), α:Zp→Zp bijective, β:Zp→Zp∖{0}, there are exactly pp polynomial permutations [f]p2 on Zp2 with [f]p=α and [f′]p=β.\\nProof\\n(1) and (3) follow immediately from Lemma 2.5 for n=2 and (2) and (4) then follow from Fact 2.7. □\\nRemark 2.9\\nFact 2.7 and Lemma 2.8(2) imply that (1) for all n⩾1, the image of Gn+1 under πn:Fn+1→Fn is contained in Gn, and (2) for all n⩾2, the inverse image of Gn under πn:Fn+1→Fn is Gn+1.\\nWe denote by πn:Gn+1→Gn the restriction of πn to Gn.\\nThis is the canonical epimorphism from the group of polynomial permutations on Zpn+1 onto the group of polynomial permutations on Zpn.\\nThe above remark allows us to draw conclusions on the projective system of groups Gn from the information in Corollary 2.4 concerning the projective system of monoids Fn.\\nCorollary 2.10\\nLet n⩾2, and πn:Gn+1→Gn the canonical epimorphism from the group of polynomial permutations on Zpn+1 onto the group of polynomial permutations on Zpn. \\nThen |ker(πn)|=pβ(n+1).\\nCorollary 2.11\\n(See cf. Kempner [10] and Keller and Olson [9].) \\nThe number of polynomial permutations on Zp2 is|G2|=p!(p-1)ppp, and for n⩾3 the number of polynomial permutations on Zp2 is |Gn|=p!(p-1)pppp∑k=3nβ(k).\\nProof\\nIn the canonical representation of f∈Z[x] in Lemma 2.5, there are p!(p-1)p choices of coefficients mod p for f0 and f1 such that the criteria of Fact 2.7 for a polynomial permutation on Zp2 are satisfied.\\nAnd for each such choice there are pp possibilities for the coefficients of f0 mod p2.\\nThe coefficients of f0 mod p2 and those of f1 mod p then determine the polynomial function mod p2.\\nSo |G2|=p!(p-1)ppp.\\nThe formula for |Gn| then follows from Corollary 2.10. □\\nThis concludes our review of polynomial functions and polynomial permutations on Zpn.\\nWe will now introduce a homomorphic image of G2 whose Sylow p-groups bijectively correspond to the Sylow p-groups of Gn for any n⩾2.\\nA group between G1 and G2\\nInto the projective system of monoids (Fn,∘) we insert an extra monoid E between F1 and F2 by means of monoid-epimorphisms θ:F2→E and ψ:E→F1 with ψθ=π1,F1←ψE←θF2←π2F3←π3⋯.\\nThe restrictions of θ to G2 and of ψ to the group of units H of E will be group-epimorphisms, so that we also insert an extra group H between G1 and G2 into the projective system of the Gi,G1←ψH←θG2←π2G3←π3….\\nIn the following definition of E and H, f and f′ are just two different names for functions.\\nThe connection with polynomials and their formal derivatives suggested by the notation will appear when we define θ and ψ.\\nDefinition\\nWe define the semigroup (E,∘) byE={(f,f′)|f:Zp→Zpf′:Zp→Zp} (where f and f′ are just symbols) with law of composition (f,f′)∘(g,g′)=(f∘g,(f′∘g)⋅g′).\\nHere (f∘g)(x)=f(g(x)) and ((f′∘g)⋅g′)(x)=f′(g(x))⋅g′(x).\\nWe denote by (H,∘) the group of units of E.\\nThe following facts are easy to verify:\\nLemma 3.1\\n(1) The identity element of E is (ι,1), with ι denoting the identity function on Zp and 1 the constant function 1.\\n(2) The group of units of E has the formH={(f,f′)|f:Zp→Zp bijective, f′:Zp→Zp∖{0}}.\\n(3) The inverse of (g,g′)∈H is(g,g′)-1=(g-1,1g′∘g-1), where g-1 is the inverse permutation of the permutation g and 1/a stands for the multiplicative inverse of a non-zero element a∈Zp, such that (1g′∘g-1)(x)=1g′(g-1(x)) means the multiplicative inverse in Zp∖{0} of g′(g-1(x)).\\nNote that H is a semidirect product of (as the normal subgroup) a direct sum of p copies of the cyclic group of order p-1 and (as the complement acting on it) the symmetric group on p letters, Sp, acting on the direct sum by permuting its components.\\nIn combinatorics, one would call this a wreath product (designed to act on the left) of the abstract group Cp-1 by the permutation group Sp with its standard action on p letters.\\n(Group theorists, however, have a narrower definition of wreath product, which is not applicable here.)\\nNow for the homomorphisms θ and ψ.\\nDefinition\\nWe define ψ:E→F1 by ψ(f,f′)=f.\\nAs for θ:F2→E, given an element [g]p2∈F2, set θ([g]p2)=([g]p,[g′]p).\\nθ is well defined by Lemma 2.8(1).\\nLemma 3.2\\n(i) θ:F2→E is a monoid-epimorphism.\\n(ii) The inverse image of H under θ:F2→E is G2.\\n(iii) The restriction of θ to G2 is a group-epimorphism θ:G2→H with |ker(θ)|=pp.\\n(iv) ψ:E→F1 is a monoid-epimorphism and ψ restricted to H is a group-epimorphism ψ:H→G1.\\nProof\\n(i) follows from Lemma 2.8(3) and (ii) from Fact 2.7.\\n(iii) follows from Lemma 2.8(4).\\nFinally, (iv) holds because every function on Zp is a polynomial function and every permutation of Zp is a polynomial permutation. □\\nSylow subgroups of H\\nWe will first determine the Sylow p-groups of H.\\nThe Sylow p-groups of Gn for n⩾2 are obtained in the next section as the inverse images of the Sylow p-groups of H under the epimorphism Gn→H.\\nLemma 4.1\\nLet C0 be the subgroup of Sp generated by the p-cycle (012…p-1).\\nThen one Sylow p-subgroup of H is S={(f,f′)∈H|f∈C0,f′=1}, where f′=1 means the constant function 1.\\nThe normalizer of S in H is NH(S)={(g,g′)|g∈NSp(C0), g′ a non-zero constant}.\\nProof\\nAs |H|=p!(p-1)p, and S is a subgroup of H of order p, S is a Sylow p-group of H.\\nConjugation of (f,f′)∈S by (g,g′)∈H (using the fact that f′=1) gives (g,g′)-1(f,f′)(g,g′)=(g-1,1g′∘g-1)(f∘g,g′)=(g-1∘f∘g,g′g′∘g-1∘f∘g).\\nThe first coordinate of (g,g′)-1(f,f′)(g,g′) being in C0 for all (f,f′)∈S is equivalent to g∈NSp(C0).\\nThe second coordinate of (g,g′)-1(f,f′)(g,g′) being the constant function 1 for all (f,f′)∈S is equivalent to ∀x∈Zp,g′(x)=g′(g-1(f(g(x)))), which is equivalent to g′ being constant on every cycle of g-1fg, which is equivalent to g′ being constant on Zp, since f can be chosen to be a p-cycle. □\\nLemma 4.2\\nAnother way of describing the normalizer of S in H is NH(S)={(g,g′)∈H|∃k≠0∀a,b,g(a)-g(b)=k(a-b); g′ a non-zero constant}.\\nTherefore, |NH(S)|=p(p-1)2 and [H:NH(S)]=(p-1)!(p-1)p-2.\\nProof\\nLet σ=(012…p-1) and g∈Sp then gσg-1=(g(0)g(1)g(2)…g(p-1)).\\nNow g∈NSp(C0) if and only if, for some 1⩽k<p, gσg-1=σk, i.e., (g(0)g(1)g(2)…g(p-1))=(0k2k…(p-1)k), all numbers taken mod p.\\nThis is equivalent to g(x+1)=g(x)+k org(x+1)-g(x)=k and further equivalent to g(a)-g(b)=k(a-b).\\nThus k and g(0) determine g∈NSp(C0), and there are (p-1) choices for k and p choices for g(0).\\nTogether with the (p-1) choices for the non-zero constant g′ this makes p(p-1)2 elements of NH(S). □\\nCorollary 4.3\\nThere are (p-1)!(p-1)p-2 Sylow p-subgroups of H.\\nTheorem 4.4\\nThe Sylow p-subgroups of H are in bijective correspondence with pairs (C,φ¯), where C is a cyclic subgroup of order p of Sp, φ:Zp→Zp∖{0} is a function and φ¯ is the class of φ with respect to the equivalence relation of multiplication by a non-zero constant.\\nThe subgroup corresponding to (C,φ¯) is S(C,φ¯)={(f,f′)∈H|f∈C,f′(x)=φ(f(x))φ(x)}.\\nProof\\nObserve that each S(C,φ¯) is a subgroup of order p of H.\\nDifferent pairs (C,φ¯) give rise to different groups: Suppose S(C,φ¯)=S(D,ψ¯).\\nThen C=D and for all x∈Zp and for all f∈C we get φ(f(x))φ(x)=ψ(f(x))ψ(x).\\nAs C is transitive on Zp the latter condition is equivalent to ∀x,y∈Zpψ(x)φ(x)=ψ(y)φ(y), which means that φ=kψ for a non-zero k∈Zp.\\nThere are (p-2)! cyclic subgroups of order p of Sp, and (p-1)p-1 equivalence classes φ¯ of functions φ:Zp→Zp∖{0}.\\nSo the number of pairs (C,φ¯) equals (p-1)!(p-1)p-2, which is the number of Sylow p-groups of H, by the preceding corollary. □\\nProposition 4.5\\nIf p is an odd prime then the intersection of all Sylow p-subgroups of H is trivial, i.e., ⋂(C,φ¯)S(C,φ¯)={(ι,1)}.\\nIf p=2 then |H|=2 and the intersection of all Sylow 2-subgroups of H is H itself.\\nProof\\nLet p be an odd prime, and let (f,f′)∈⋂(C,φ¯)S(C,φ¯).\\nSuppose f is not the identity function and let k∈Zp such that f(k)≠k.\\nNote that φ in (C,φ¯) is arbitrary, apart from the fact that 0 is not in the image.\\nTherefore, and because p⩾3, among the various φ there occur functions ϑ and η with ϑ(k)=η(k) and ϑ(f(k))≠η(f(k)).\\nNow (f,f′)∈S(D,ϑ¯)∩S(E,η¯) for any cyclic subgroups D and E of Sp of order p.\\nTherefore ϑ(f(k))ϑ(k)=f′(k)=η(f(k))η(k), and hence ϑ(f(k))=η(f(k)), a contradiction.\\nThus f is the identity and therefore f′=1.\\nIf p=2 then |H|=2 and therefore the one and only Sylow 2-subgroup of H is H. □\\nIn the case p⩾5, the lemma above can be proved in a simpler way: There is more than one cyclic group of order p, so for (f,f′)∈⋂(C,φ¯)S(C,φ¯), there are distinct cyclic groups D and E of order p with f∈D∩E.\\nTherefore f has to be the identity.\\nSylow subgroups of Gn and of the projective limit\\nAgain we consider the projective system of finite groups G1←ψH←θG2←π2⋯←πn-1Gn←πn where (Gn,∘) is the group of polynomial permutations on Zpn (with respect to composition of functions) and H is the group defined in section 3.\\nLet G=limGn be the projective limit of this system.\\nRecall that a Sylow p-group of a pro-finite group is defined as a maximal group consisting of elements whose order in each of the finite groups in the projective system is a power of p.\\nTheorem 5.1\\n(i) Let (Gn,∘) be the group of polynomial permutations on Zpn with respect to composition.\\nIf n⩾2 there are (p-1)!(p-1)p-2 Sylow p-groups of Gn.\\nThey are the inverse images of the Sylow p-groups of H (described in Theorem 4.4) under the canonical projection π:Gn→H, with π=θπ2…πn-1.\\n(ii) Let G=limGn.\\nThere are (p-1)!(p-1)p-2 Sylow p-groups of G, which are the inverse images of the Sylow p-groups of H (described in Theorem 4.4) under the canonical projection π:G→H.\\nProof\\nIn the projective system G1←ψH←θG2←π2⋯←πn-1Gn the kernel of the group-epimorphism Gn→H is a finite p-group for every n⩾2, because for n⩾2 the kernel of πn:Gn+1→Gn is of order pβ(n+1) by Corollary 2.10 θ:G2→H is of order pp by Lemma 3.2(iii).\\nSo the Sylow p-groups of Gn for n⩾2 are just the inverse images of the Sylow p-groups of H and, likewise, the Sylow p-groups of the projective limit G are just the inverse images of the Sylow p-groups of H, whose number was determined in Corollary 4.3. □\\nIf we combine this information with the description of the Sylow p-groups of H in Theorem 4.4 we get the following explicit description of the Sylow p-groups of Gn.\\nRecall that [f]pn denotes the function induced on Zpn by the polynomial f in Z[x] (or in Zpm[x] for some m⩾n).\\nCorollary 5.2\\nLet n⩾2.\\nLet Gn be the group (with respect to composition) of polynomial permutations on Zpn.\\nThe Sylow p-groups of Gn are in bijective correspondence with pairs (C,φ¯), where C is a cyclic subgroup of order p of Sp, φ:Zp→Zp∖{0} is a function and φ¯ its class with respect to the equivalence relation of multiplication by a non-zero constant.\\nThe subgroup corresponding to (C,φ¯) is S(C,φ¯)={[f]pn∈Gn|[f]p∈C,[f′]p(x)=φ([f]p(x))φ(x)}.\\nExample\\nA particularly easy to describe Sylow p-group of Gn is the one corresponding to (C,φ) where φ is a constant function and C the subgroup of Sp generated by (012…p-1).\\nIt is the inverse image of S defined in Lemma 4.1 and it consists of the functions on Zpn induced by polynomials f such that the formal derivative f′ induces the constant function 1 on Zp and the function induced by f itself on Zp is a power of (012…p-1).\\nCombining Theorem 5.1 with Proposition 4.5 we obtain the following description of the intersection of all Sylow p-groups of Gn for odd p.\\nCorollary 5.3\\nLet p be an odd prime.\\n(i) For n⩾2 the intersection of all Sylow p-groups of Gn is the kernel of the projection π:G→H.\\n(ii) Likewise, the intersection of all Sylow p-groups of G is the kernel of the canonical epimorphism of G onto H.\\n(iii) The intersection of all Sylow p-groups of Gn (n⩾2) can also be described as the normal subgroup N={[f]pn∈Gn|[f]p=ι, [f′]p=1}, where ι denotes the identity function on Zp.\\nIts order is ppp∑k=3nβ(k) and its index in Gn (for n⩾2) is [Gn:N]=p!(p-1)p.\\n(iv) Likewise, the index of the intersection of all Sylow p-subgroups of G in G is p!(p-1)p.\\nProof\\n(i) and (ii) follow immediately from Theorem 5.1 and Proposition 4.5.\\nTo see (iii), let π be the projection from Gn to H (that is π=θπ2…πn-1).\\nThen N is the inverse image of {(ι,1)}, the identity element of H, under π, and is therefore the intersection of the Sylow p-groups of Gn by (i).\\nAs the kernel of a group homomorphism, N is a normal subgroup.\\nThe order of N is the order of the kernel of π, which is the product of pp (the order of the kernel of θ) and pβ(k) (the order of the kernel of πk-1) for 3⩽k⩽n.\\nFinally, the index of the kernel of the homomorphism of Gn or G onto H is the order of H which is p!(p-1)p. □\\nAcknowledgments\\nThe authors wish to thank W.

      "Fix a prime p and let n∈N.  Every polynomial f∈Z[x] defines a function from Zpn= to itself.  If this function happens to be bijective, it is called a polynomial permutation of Zpn.  The polynomial permutations of Zpn form a group (Gn,∘) with respect to composition.  The order of this group has been known since at least 1921 (Kempner [10]) to be |G2|=p!(p-1)ppp and |Gn|=p!(p-1)pppp∑k=3nβ(k) for n⩾3, where β(k) is the least n such that pk divides n!, but the structure of (Gn,∘) is elusive.  Since the order of Gn is divisible by a high power of (p-1) for large p, even the number of Sylow p-groups is not obvious.  We will show that there are (p-1)!(p-1)p-2 Sylow p-groups of Gn and describe these Sylow p-groups, see Theorem 5.1 and Corollary 5.2.  Some notation: p is a fixed prime throughout.  A function g:Zpn→Zpn arising from a polynomial in Zpn[x] or, equivalently, from a polynomial in Z[x], is called a polynomial function on Zpn.  We denote by (Fn,∘) the monoid with respect to composition of polynomial functions on Zpn.  By monoid, we mean semigroup with an identity element.  Let (Gn,∘) be the group of units of (Fn,∘), which is the group of polynomial permutations of Zpn.  Since every function induced by a polynomial preserves congruences modulo ideals, there is a natural epimorphism mapping polynomial functions on Zpn+1 onto polynomial functions on Zpn, and we write it as πn:Fn+1→Fn.  If f is a polynomial in Z[x] (or in Zpm[x] for m⩾n) we denote the polynomial function on Zpn[x] induced by f by [f]pn.  The order of Fn and that of Gn have been determined by Kempner [10] in a rather complicated manner.  His results were cast into a simpler form by Nöbauer [14] and Keller and Olson [9] among others.  Since then there have been many generalizations of the order formulas to more general finite rings [16,13,2,6,1,8,7].  Also, polynomial permutations in several variables (permutations of (Zpn)k defined by k-tuples of polynomials in k variables) have been looked into [5,4,19,17,18,11].  To put things in context, we recall some well-known facts, to be found, among other places, in [10,14,3,9].  The reader familiar with polynomial functions on finite rings is encouraged to skip to Section 3.  Note that we do not claim anything in Section 2 as new.  For p prime and n∈N, let αp(n)=∑k=1∞[npk] and βp(n)=min{m|αp(m)⩾n}.  If p is fixed, we just write α(n) and β(n).  For k∈N, let (x)k=x(x-1)…(x-k+1) and (x)0=1.  We denote p-adic valuation by vp.  (1) αp(n)=vp(n!).  (2) For 1⩽n⩽p, βp(n)=np and for n>p, βp(n)<np.  (3) For all n∈Z, vp((n)k)⩾αp(k); and vp((k)k)=vp(k!)=αp(k).  The sequence (βp(n))n=1∞ is obtained by going through the natural numbers in increasing order and repeating each k∈Nvp(k) times.  For instance, β2(n) for n⩾1 is: 2,4,4,6,8,8,8,10,12,12,14,16,16,16,16,18,20,20,….  The falling factorials (x)0=1, (x)k=x(x-1)…(x-k+1), k>0, form a basis of the free Z-module Z[x], and representation with respect to this basis gives a convenient canonical form for a polynomial representing a given polynomial function on Zpn.  (Cf. Keller and Olson [9].)  A polynomial f∈Z[x], f=∑kak(x)k, induces the zero-function mod pn if and only if ak≡0 mod pn-α(k) for all k (or, equivalently, for all k<β(n)).  (Cf. Keller and Olson [9].)  Every polynomial function on Zpn is represented by a unique f∈Z[x] of the form f=∑k=0β(n)-1ak(x)k, with 0⩽ak<pn-α(k) for all k.  Let (Fn,∘) be the monoid of polynomial functions on Zpn with respect to composition and πn:Fn+1→Fn the canonical projection.  (1) For all n⩾1 and for each f∈Fn we have |πn-1(f)|=pβ(n+1).  (2) For all n⩾1, the number of polynomial functions on Zpn is|Fn|=p∑k=1nβ(k).  We write [f]pn for the function defined by f∈Z[x] on Zpn.  Every polynomial f∈Z[x] is uniquely representable asf(x)=f0(x)+f1(x)(xp-x)+f2(x)(xp-x)2+⋯+fm(x)(xp-x)m+⋯ with fm∈Z[x], degfm<p, for all m⩾0.  Now let f,g∈Z[x].  (1) If n⩽p, then [f]pn=[g]pn is equivalent to: fk=gk mod pn-kZ[x] for 0⩽k<n.  (2) [f]p2=[g]p2 is equivalent to: f0=g0 mod p2Z[x] and f1=g1 mod pZ[x].  (3) [f]p=[g]p and [f′]p=[g′]p is equivalent to: f0=g0 mod pZ[x] and f1=g1 mod pZ[x].  The canonical representation is obtained by repeated division with remainder by (xp-x), and uniqueness follows from uniqueness of quotient and remainder of polynomial division.  Note that [f]p=[f0]p and [f′]p=[f0′-f1]p.  This gives (3).  Denote by f∼g the equivalence relation fk=gk mod pn-kZ[x] for 0⩽k<n.  Then f∼g implies [f]pn=[g]pn.  There are pp+2p+3p+⋯+np equivalence classes of ∼ and pβ(1)+β(2)+β(3)+⋯+β(n) different [f]pn.  For k⩽p, β(k)=kp.  Therefore the equivalence relations f∼g and [f]pn=[g]pn coincide.  We can rephrase this in terms of ideals of Z[x].  For every n∈N, consider the two ideals of Z[x]In={f∈Z[x]|f(Z)⊆pnZ} and Jn=({pn-k(xp-x)k|0⩽k⩽n}).  Then [Z[x]:In]=pβ(1)+β(2)+β(3)+⋯+β(n) and [Z[x]:Jn]=pp+2p+3p+⋯+np.  Therefore, Jn=In for n⩽p, whereas for n>p, Jn is properly contained in In.  The index of Jn in Z[x] is pp+2p+3p+⋯+np, because f∈Jn if and only if fk=0 mod pn-kZ[x] for 0⩽k<n in the canonical representation of Lemma 2.5.  Let n⩾2.  The function on Zpn induced by a polynomial f∈Z[x] is a permutation if and only if (1) f induces a permutation of Zp, and (2) the derivative f′ has no zero mod p.  Then (1) [f]p2 determines not just [f]p, but also [f′]p.  (2) Let n⩾2.  Then [f]pn is a permutation if and only if [f]p2 is a permutation.  (3) For every pair of functions (α,β), α:Zp→Zp, β:Zp→Zp, there are exactly pp polynomial functions [f]p2 on Zp2 with [f]p=α and [f′]p=β.  (4) For every pair of functions (α,β), α:Zp→Zp bijective, β:Zp→Zp∖{0}, there are exactly pp polynomial permutations [f]p2 on Zp2 with [f]p=α and [f′]p=β.  Fact 2.7 and Lemma 2.8(2) imply that (1) for all n⩾1, the image of Gn+1 under πn:Fn+1→Fn is contained in Gn, and (2) for all n⩾2, the inverse image of Gn under πn:Fn+1→Fn is Gn+1.  We denote by πn:Gn+1→Gn the restriction of πn to Gn.  This is the canonical epimorphism from the group of polynomial permutations on Zpn+1 onto the group of polynomial permutations on Zpn.  The above remark allows us to draw conclusions on the projective system of groups Gn from the information in Corollary 2.4 concerning the projective system of monoids Fn.  Then |ker(πn)|=pβ(n+1).  The number of polynomial permutations on Zp2 is|G2|=p!(p-1)ppp, and for n⩾3 the number of polynomial permutations on Zp2 is |Gn|=p!(p-1)pppp∑k=3nβ(k).  In the canonical representation of f∈Z[x] in Lemma 2.5, there are p!(p-1)p choices of coefficients mod p for f0 and f1 such that the criteria of Fact 2.7 for a polynomial permutation on Zp2 are satisfied.  And for each such choice there are pp possibilities for the coefficients of f0 mod p2.  The coefficients of f0 mod p2 and those of f1 mod p then determine the polynomial function mod p2.  So |G2|=p!(p-1)ppp.  This concludes our review of polynomial functions and polynomial permutations on Zpn.  We will now introduce a homomorphic image of G2 whose Sylow p-groups bijectively correspond to the Sylow p-groups of Gn for any n⩾2.  Into the projective system of monoids (Fn,∘) we insert an extra monoid E between F1 and F2 by means of monoid-epimorphisms θ:F2→E and ψ:E→F1 with ψθ=π1,F1←ψE←θF2←π2F3←π3⋯.  The restrictions of θ to G2 and of ψ to the group of units H of E will be group-epimorphisms, so that we also insert an extra group H between G1 and G2 into the projective system of the Gi,G1←ψH←θG2←π2G3←π3….  In the following definition of E and H, f and f′ are just two different names for functions.  The connection with polynomials and their formal derivatives suggested by the notation will appear when we define θ and ψ.  We define the semigroup (E,∘) byE={(f,f′)|f:Zp→Zpf′:Zp→Zp} (where f and f′ are just symbols) with law of composition (f,f′)∘(g,g′)=(f∘g,(f′∘g)⋅g′).  Here (f∘g)(x)=f(g(x)) and ((f′∘g)⋅g′)(x)=f′(g(x))⋅g′(x).  We denote by (H,∘) the group of units of E.  (1) The identity element of E is (ι,1), with ι denoting the identity function on Zp and 1 the constant function 1.  (2) The group of units of E has the formH={(f,f′)|f:Zp→Zp bijective, f′:Zp→Zp∖{0}}.  (3) The inverse of (g,g′)∈H is(g,g′)-1=(g-1,1g′∘g-1), where g-1 is the inverse permutation of the permutation g and 1/a stands for the multiplicative inverse of a non-zero element a∈Zp, such that (1g′∘g-1)(x)=1g′(g-1(x)) means the multiplicative inverse in Zp∖{0} of g′(g-1(x)).  Note that H is a semidirect product of (as the normal subgroup) a direct sum of p copies of the cyclic group of order p-1 and (as the complement acting on it) the symmetric group on p letters, Sp, acting on the direct sum by permuting its components.  In combinatorics, one would call this a wreath product (designed to act on the left) of the abstract group Cp-1 by the permutation group Sp with its standard action on p letters.  (Group theorists, however, have a narrower definition of wreath product, which is not applicable here.)  Now for the homomorphisms θ and ψ.  We define ψ:E→F1 by ψ(f,f′)=f.  As for θ:F2→E, given an element [g]p2∈F2, set θ([g]p2)=([g]p,[g′]p).  θ is well defined by Lemma 2.8(1).  (i) θ:F2→E is a monoid-epimorphism.  (ii) The inverse image of H under θ:F2→E is G2.  (iii) The restriction of θ to G2 is a group-epimorphism θ:G2→H with |ker(θ)|=pp.  (iv) ψ:E→F1 is a monoid-epimorphism and ψ restricted to H is a group-epimorphism ψ:H→G1.  (i) follows from Lemma 2.8(3) and (ii) from Fact 2.7.  (iii) follows from Lemma 2.8(4).  We will first determine the Sylow p-groups of H.  The Sylow p-groups of Gn for n⩾2 are obtained in the next section as the inverse images of the Sylow p-groups of H under the epimorphism Gn→H.  Let C0 be the subgroup of Sp generated by the p-cycle (012…p-1).  Then one Sylow p-subgroup of H is S={(f,f′)∈H|f∈C0,f′=1}, where f′=1 means the constant function 1.  The normalizer of S in H is NH(S)={(g,g′)|g∈NSp(C0), g′ a non-zero constant}.  As |H|=p!(p-1)p, and S is a subgroup of H of order p, S is a Sylow p-group of H.  Conjugation of (f,f′)∈S by (g,g′)∈H (using the fact that f′=1) gives (g,g′)-1(f,f′)(g,g′)=(g-1,1g′∘g-1)(f∘g,g′)=(g-1∘f∘g,g′g′∘g-1∘f∘g).  The first coordinate of (g,g′)-1(f,f′)(g,g′) being in C0 for all (f,f′)∈S is equivalent to g∈NSp(C0).  Another way of describing the normalizer of S in H is NH(S)={(g,g′)∈H|∃k≠0∀a,b,g(a)-g(b)=k(a-b); g′ a non-zero constant}.  Therefore, |NH(S)|=p(p-1)2 and [H:NH(S)]=(p-1)!(p-1)p-2.  Let σ=(012…p-1) and g∈Sp then gσg-1=(g(0)g(1)g(2)…g(p-1)).  Now g∈NSp(C0) if and only if, for some 1⩽k<p, gσg-1=σk, i.e., (g(0)g(1)g(2)…g(p-1))=(0k2k…(p-1)k), all numbers taken mod p.  This is equivalent to g(x+1)=g(x)+k org(x+1)-g(x)=k and further equivalent to g(a)-g(b)=k(a-b).  Thus k and g(0) determine g∈NSp(C0), and there are (p-1) choices for k and p choices for g(0).  There are (p-1)!(p-1)p-2 Sylow p-subgroups of H.  The Sylow p-subgroups of H are in bijective correspondence with pairs (C,φ¯), where C is a cyclic subgroup of order p of Sp, φ:Zp→Zp∖{0} is a function and φ¯ is the class of φ with respect to the equivalence relation of multiplication by a non-zero constant.  The subgroup corresponding to (C,φ¯) is S(C,φ¯)={(f,f′)∈H|f∈C,f′(x)=φ(f(x))φ(x)}.  Observe that each S(C,φ¯) is a subgroup of order p of H.  Different pairs (C,φ¯) give rise to different groups: Suppose S(C,φ¯)=S(D,ψ¯).  Then C=D and for all x∈Zp and for all f∈C we get φ(f(x))φ(x)=ψ(f(x))ψ(x).  As C is transitive on Zp the latter condition is equivalent to ∀x,y∈Zpψ(x)φ(x)=ψ(y)φ(y), which means that φ=kψ for a non-zero k∈Zp.  There are (p-2)! cyclic subgroups of order p of Sp, and (p-1)p-1 equivalence classes φ¯ of functions φ:Zp→Zp∖{0}.  If p is an odd prime then the intersection of all Sylow p-subgroups of H is trivial, i.e., ⋂(C,φ¯)S(C,φ¯)={(ι,1)}.  If p=2 then |H|=2 and the intersection of all Sylow 2-subgroups of H is H itself.  Let p be an odd prime, and let (f,f′)∈⋂(C,φ¯)S(C,φ¯).  Suppose f is not the identity function and let k∈Zp such that f(k)≠k.  Note that φ in (C,φ¯) is arbitrary, apart from the fact that 0 is not in the image.  Therefore, and because p⩾3, among the various φ there occur functions ϑ and η with ϑ(k)=η(k) and ϑ(f(k))≠η(f(k)).  Now (f,f′)∈S(D,ϑ¯)∩S(E,η¯) for any cyclic subgroups D and E of Sp of order p.  Therefore ϑ(f(k))ϑ(k)=f′(k)=η(f(k))η(k), and hence ϑ(f(k))=η(f(k)), a contradiction.  Thus f is the identity and therefore f′=1.  In the case p⩾5, the lemma above can be proved in a simpler way: There is more than one cyclic group of order p, so for (f,f′)∈⋂(C,φ¯)S(C,φ¯), there are distinct cyclic groups D and E of order p with f∈D∩E.  Therefore f has to be the identity.  Again we consider the projective system of finite groups G1←ψH←θG2←π2⋯←πn-1Gn←πn where (Gn,∘) is the group of polynomial permutations on Zpn (with respect to composition of functions) and H is the group defined in section 3.  Let G=limGn be the projective limit of this system.  Recall that a Sylow p-group of a pro-finite group is defined as a maximal group consisting of elements whose order in each of the finite groups in the projective system is a power of p.  (i) Let (Gn,∘) be the group of polynomial permutations on Zpn with respect to composition.  If n⩾2 there are (p-1)!(p-1)p-2 Sylow p-groups of Gn.  They are the inverse images of the Sylow p-groups of H (described in Theorem 4.4) under the canonical projection π:Gn→H, with π=θπ2…πn-1.  (ii) Let G=limGn.  There are (p-1)!(p-1)p-2 Sylow p-groups of G, which are the inverse images of the Sylow p-groups of H (described in Theorem 4.4) under the canonical projection π:G→H.  In the projective system G1←ψH←θG2←π2⋯←πn-1Gn the kernel of the group-epimorphism Gn→H is a finite p-group for every n⩾2, because for n⩾2 the kernel of πn:Gn+1→Gn is of order pβ(n+1) by Corollary 2.10 θ:G2→H is of order pp by Lemma 3.2(iii).  If we combine this information with the description of the Sylow p-groups of H in Theorem 4.4 we get the following explicit description of the Sylow p-groups of Gn.  Recall that [f]pn denotes the function induced on Zpn by the polynomial f in Z[x] (or in Zpm[x] for some m⩾n).  Let n⩾2.  Let Gn be the group (with respect to composition) of polynomial permutations on Zpn.  The Sylow p-groups of Gn are in bijective correspondence with pairs (C,φ¯), where C is a cyclic subgroup of order p of Sp, φ:Zp→Zp∖{0} is a function and φ¯ its class with respect to the equivalence relation of multiplication by a non-zero constant.  The subgroup corresponding to (C,φ¯) is S(C,φ¯)={[f]pn∈Gn|[f]p∈C,[f′]p(x)=φ([f]p(x))φ(x)}.  A particularly easy to describe Sylow p-group of Gn is the one corresponding to (C,φ) where φ is a constant function and C the subgroup of Sp generated by (012…p-1).  It is the inverse image of S defined in Lemma 4.1 and it consists of the functions on Zpn induced by polynomials f such that the formal derivative f′ induces the constant function 1 on Zp and the function induced by f itself on Zp is a power of (012…p-1).  Combining Theorem 5.1 with Proposition 4.5 we obtain the following description of the intersection of all Sylow p-groups of Gn for odd p.  Let p be an odd prime.  (i) For n⩾2 the intersection of all Sylow p-groups of Gn is the kernel of the projection π:G→H.  (ii) Likewise, the intersection of all Sylow p-groups of G is the kernel of the canonical epimorphism of G onto H.  (iii) The intersection of all Sylow p-groups of Gn (n⩾2) can also be described as the normal subgroup N={[f]pn∈Gn|[f]p=ι, [f′]p=1}, where ι denotes the identity function on Zp.  Its order is ppp∑k=3nβ(k) and its index in Gn (for n⩾2) is [Gn:N]=p!(p-1)p.  (iv) Likewise, the index of the intersection of all Sylow p-subgroups of G in G is p!(p-1)p.  (i) and (ii) follow immediately from Theorem 5.1 and Proposition 4.5.  To see (iii), let π be the projection from Gn to H (that is π=θπ2…πn-1).  Then N is the inverse image of {(ι,1)}, the identity element of H, under π, and is therefore the intersection of the Sylow p-groups of Gn by (i).  As the kernel of a group homomorphism, N is a normal subgroup.  The order of N is the order of the kernel of π, which is the product of pp (the order of the kernel of θ) and pβ(k) (the order of the kernel of πk-1) for 3⩽k⩽n.  The authors wish to thank W.
